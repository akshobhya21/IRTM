              "'\\x0cPonniyin Selvan Part 4\\n\\nThe Crown\\n\\nAuthor:\\n\\nKalki\\n\\nRendered In English By:\\n\\nVaralotti Rengasamy\\n\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 1 - On The Banks of River Kedilam\\n\\nMany rivers ran through the country of Thirumunaippadi and made it fertile.\\nRiver Kedilam was one of them. Lord Shiva who won over the heart of one of\\nthe greatest Nayanmars, Thirunavukkarasar was in Thiruvadikai Veerattanam\\nwhich was on the banks of River Kedilam. The Lord who won over another\\ngreat Nayanmar Sundaramurthy resided in Thirunavalur which was very close to\\nthe river. Between these two holy places ran the highway that connected the\\nThondai Mandalam, the Chozha Kingdom and the Central Provinces. The place\\nwhere the highway crossed River Kedilam would be buzzing with activity\\nthroughout the day all round the year. The passengers would stop there for rest.\\nThe bullocks would be unyoked from the carts. People would have their food in\\nthat place. When they ate they would playfully throw cooked rice in the air\\nwhich would be eagerly picked up by the hungry crows. Children seeing this\\nsight would applaud and make strange sounds with their mouths - aahoo...aahoo.\\n\\nIt was the beginning of the Tamil month of Aippasi which corresponded to\\nOctober-November of English calendar. There was more water in the river than\\nusual. The travellers who had stopped there for lunch were excited. The\\nexcitement resulted in a loud conversation. The whole place was noisy. And then\\ncame a noise which subdued all other sounds. The travellers were startled by the\\nsudden noise. Some of them climbed up the bank to check the source of the\\nsound. At first they could see only a screen of dust. Then they saw the Royal\\nparaphernalia. There were elephants, horses, palanquins and standard bearers.\\nWhen the retinue came near them they could hear the sound of the person\\nheralding the royal dignitary.\\n\\n“Hail the greatest of warriors who entered the battle-field at the age of twelve,\\nthe Kopparakeasari who beheaded Veerapandiyan, the lion feared by those in the\\nTwin Provinces even in their dreams, the Head of the Northern Armed Forces,\\nthe first born of Emperor Sundara Chozhan who reigns over the three worlds, the\\none and only Adithya Karikala Chozhan!”\\n\\n\\x0cWhen the booming voice of the herald echoed in all the directions all the people\\non the banks of River Kedilam ran up to meet the Crown Prince. They stood on\\neither sides of the road leaving a clear way of passage for the royal retinue.\\n\\nHeralds, the trumpet blowers and the standard bearers reached the river first.\\nThree horses came in the rear. The horses carried young warriors. Even when\\nthey were at a distance people started pointing at them to identify them.\\n\\n“The one who comes in the middle is Adithya Karikalan. You should know by\\nthe golden crown that adorns his head. See how the crown shines in the rays of\\nthe sun.”\\n\\n“You are praising this crown! You should see him wearing the grand crown of\\nKarikal Valavan. They say that it will shine like a million suns.”\\n\\n“Thambi that’s not the crown of Karikal Valavan. It is so described more to\\nhonour a tradition. The truth is that our emperor Sundara Chozhan is wearing the\\ncrown which was made during the times of Emperor Paranthaka. Nobody knows\\nhow long he will wear that crown.”\\n\\n“Looks like everyone is worried about the life of Sundara Chozhan for quite\\nsome time. I have an intuition that he will live long.”\\n\\n“May your words come true. Let him live long. So long as he lives there won’t\\nbe any chaos in the Kingdom.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Well, I don’t buy that stuff, brother. Since the news of Ponniyin Selvan’s death\\nthe whole Chozha country is in a state of turmoil. A war may break out at any\\ntime. So say the people coming from the Chozha country.”\\n\\n“Who’s going to fight with whom? What for?”\\n\\n“They say that a war might break out between the Pazhuvettaraiyars and the\\nKodumbalur Chieftain. The Chieftains are assembling at the Kadambur\\nSambuvarayar Palace to prevent that war. Our Crown Prince too is going there.”\\n\\n“The horses have come near. Don’t be so loud. It’ll land us in trouble.” - warned\\nanother guy. He also added:\\n\\n“See the grief in the face of the Crown Prince.”\\n\\n“How can it be otherwise? His brother is dearer to him than his own life. And if\\nthere’s no news about such a dear brother how can he be happy? See his plight.\\nHis father is in death bed. His brother’s fate is not known.”\\n\\n“That’s not the reason for his grief. He wants to invade the Twin Provinces. He is\\nfrustrated because that could not happen.”\\n\\n“Why? Who prevented him from waging a war against those Provinces?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Who else but the Pazhuvettaraiyars? They refuse to give him the weapons and\\nsupplies necessary for a war of such magnitude.”\\n\\n“Everyone has his own reason. No one knows the real reason behind the Prince’s\\ngrief.”\\n\\n“Oh, here comes the great Mr. Know-all. We give up. You tell us the real\\nreason.”\\n\\n“Adithya Karikalan fell in love with a girl from the Pandya Kingdom. When the\\nPrince went for the North Pennai War the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar forcibly\\nmarried that girl. And that girl is now the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur. And she\\nhas unleashed a reign of terror in Chozha Kingdom. The Crown Prince has lost\\nhis mind after all these developments.”\\n\\n“May be. May be. Who knows? You know our elders have said that all the wars\\nin the world are caused by a woman.”\\n\\n“Which elders told you that? That’s nonsense. If a Prince had fallen in love with\\na girl do you think that the girl would marry a sixty year old man? People may\\nsay a thousand things. Shouldn’t we use our brains?”\\n\\n“Ok, agreed. Now you tell me why Adithya Karikalan is not yet married?”\\n\\n“Shut up. They have come near. The one who comes to the right of the Prince is\\nParthibendra Pallavan. Who’s in the left? Isn’t that Vallavaraiyan Vandhiya\\n\\n\\x0cThevan of the Vaana clan?”\\n\\n“No. That’s Kandhanmaran, son of Kadambur Sambuvarayar. Sambuvarayar\\nknew very well that if he sent a message the Crown Prince may not come. So he\\nsent his own son as the messenger.”\\n\\n“Which means the matter is very, very important.”\\n\\n“The matter could be political. Or concerning the marriage of the Crown Prince.\\nThe Chieftains would be casting their net for the Prince - to marry off their\\ndaughters to him. The girl who marries him first would be the Queen of the\\nChozha Empire.”\\n\\nThe spectators at the banks of River Kedilam were talking so many things. The\\nthree horses stood near the bank. The chariot stood a little away under the shade\\nof the pupil tree. The sole occupant of the chariot was the eighty-year old\\nwarrior Thirukkovilur Malayaman, the Emperor’s father-in-law and Karikalan’s\\ngrandfather.\\n\\nAdithya Karikalan turned back to look at his grandfather without getting off his\\nhorse.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 2 - The Grandfather And The Grandson\\n\\nThe old man in the chariot signalled to Adithya Karikalan. The Crown Prince\\nturned his horse and went towards the chariot.\\n\\n“Karikala, my child! It is time to take leave of you. I am going back to\\nThirukkovalur. I want to share something important with you before I go. Get\\ndown from the horse and come to that platform below the pupil tree over there.”\\n\\n“As you please, Thaatha.”\\n\\nThe grandfather and the grandson dismounted and walked towards the platform.\\n\\nParthibendran spoke to Kandhanmaran.\\n\\n“Thank God the old man decided to leave us. I was afraid that he might cling on\\nto us till we reach our destination.”\\n\\n“If only he did I had decided to push him into Vellaru and drown him.”\\n\\nThe young men laughed together.\\n\\n\\x0cMalainadu Udaiyar, also known as Thirukkovalur Malaiyaman, started a long\\nnarration:\\n\\n“Adithya, you were born twenty four years ago. You were born in my palace at\\nThirukkovalur. Oh My God! I can’t forget the celebration to mark your birth. It\\nappears as if they happened only yesterday. People from your clan, my clan and\\nall the Chieftains of the Chozha and Thondai Mandalam Kingdoms had come.\\nThirty thousand soldiers had come along with those Kings. I hosted a feast for\\nall of them. I don’t have words to describe the grandeur of the feast. It was\\ngrander than even the coronation ceremony of your father. What my ancestors\\nhad accumulated in the treasury for a hundred years, I spent in the three-daycelebration to mark your birth.\\n\\n“Your great grandfather Emperor Paranthaka visited Thirukkovalur on the\\noccasion. Your grandfather’s brother Kandaraathithar and your father Sundara\\nChozhan had come. When they learnt that a boy had been born, their joy knew\\nno bounds. They were happy that you came into this world to continue the line\\nof Chozha clan unbroken. Your grandfather’s elder brothers did not have sons till\\nthen. Your father was the only son to your grandfather Arinjaya Chozhan.\\n\\nYour father at your age was as handsome as the Love-God. Nobody had seen\\nsuch a handsome man either in the Chozha clan or in any other clans of\\nTamilnadu. Of course your father had some troubles on account of his good\\nlooks. He was the most favoured child in the family. The women in the palace\\nwould dress him up as a woman. ‘If only he were a woman!’ they used to tell\\noften. When he came of age all the kings from Srilanka to Vindyas were ready to\\noffer their daughters to him. Not only was your father as handsome as Arjuna\\nand the Love-God, he was the heir apparent of the Chozha throne. So there was a\\nfierce competition amongst the Kings to have your father as their son-in-law. I\\nwas the lucky one to have that unique honour.\\n\\n“We, Malaiyamans, whether men or women, are not known for our looks. We\\n\\n\\x0cwere a race who always thought that a man’s beauty is directly proportional to\\nthe number of war-wounds on his body. For our women, beauty only meant\\ncharacter and morality. When it was decided that your father should marry my\\ndaughter, my Kingdom erupted into such a grand celebration that the Chieftains\\nof Tamilnadu were burning in jealousy over our good fortune. I could not care\\nless. Your parents got married in Thanjavur. The whole world was amazed by the\\nway the wedding was celebrated. The only event that was celebrated in a grander\\nmanner than your parents’ wedding was your birth. The happy discussion and\\ndebate we had to decide on your name still lingers in my memory. Some said\\nthat you should be named after your illustrious ancestor Karikal Valavan. I and a\\nfew others insisted that you should be named after your grandfather’s brother,\\nRajadithya. Finally we arrived at a compromise by having the best of both the\\nworlds - you were named Adithya Karikalan.\\n\\n“Look over there, Adithya! You can see Thirunavalur’s temple tower. That was\\nthe place where Nambi Aarooran was born. Twenty five years ago your\\ngrandfather’s brother Rajadithya Chozhan camped there. I have heard many\\nstories of warriors. I have seen many of them in Tamilnadu, a country known for\\nits valour. But I have not seen anybody as valiant as Rajadithya Chozhan.\\nWhosoever watched him fighting on that day would agree with me.\\n\\nHe camped here to gather a large army and invade the provinces in the North. He\\nhad vowed to defeat the King of the Twin Provinces, Kannara Devan and raze\\nhis capital Maniyakedam to ground. You know, once in the past the Pallava\\nEmperor destroyed the capital of Vathaapi. Rajadithyar wanted to do the same to\\nManiyakedam to teach a lesson to the Twin Provinces. And if he did that he too\\nwill become popular like Mamallan, the great Pallava King who conquered the\\nPulikesis. Do you think it’s an easy task to gather army for such an ambitious\\nwar? It is said that the Pallava King Mamallan spent seven years to gather an\\narmy to invade Vaathapi. Rajadithya said that he did not need such a long time\\nand that he would have the army ready in three or four years. He chose the area\\nbetween River Kedilam and River Thenpannai as the best place to recruit the\\narmy and train them in warfare.\\n\\n\\x0cAdithya, you are not fortunate enough to witness the scene that unfolded in a\\nplace between the two rivers. And those who saw it could not forget it for the\\nrest of their lives. Rajadithya stayed in Thirunavalur along with thirty thousand\\nsoldiers. A chieftain from the Chera Kingdom by name Vellan Kumaran was\\ncamping on the banks of Pennai River along with twenty thousand soldiers. Your\\ngrandfather Arinjaya Chozhan was with me in Thirukkovalur. Arinjayan and I\\nrecruited and trained fifty thousand soldiers for the war. Along with us were the\\nSenior Velar of Kodumbalur, the Pazhuvettaraiyar - who has now become the\\ncurse of Chozha Kingdom, Kadambur Sambuvaraiyar - the chieftain of this\\nplace, Thirumunaippadi, Munaiyatharaiyan, Mazhavaraiyar of Mazhanadu, the\\nKundrathur Kizhar and Vaithumbarayan, along with their vast armies. Huge\\nbattalions of cavalry, armies of elephants and the three great infantry regiments\\nof Kaikolas also camped along with us.\\n\\nWe had a lot of mock battles amongst ourselves for training. When elephants\\ncrashed against elephants the sound and the shock would resemble that of an\\nearth quake. When the soldiers wielding shining spears rode on the horses the\\nresultant sound would resemble the roar of the oceans during an apocalypse.\\nWhen the soldiers shot a barrage of arrows in the air the skies would be covered\\nby a screen of arrows. When the infantry marched ahead shouting battle cries it\\nwould appear that the end of the world was near. Scores of civilians would come\\nthere to witness the feats.\\n\\nThe people of this Thirumunaippadi country and the Middle Provinces are very\\ngood. They are known for their valour. While the army was stationed here, their\\nagricultural activities were affected. But they did not mind. As a measure of\\nexpressing his gratitude to these people Rajadithya ordered his people to dig a\\nlot of lakes in these countries. He brought the Coleroon River up to Veera\\nNarayanapuram and filled the lake with the water from the river. The one person\\nwho derived the maximum benefit from that project was Kadambur\\nSambuvaraiyar. In those days he used to be very humble and subservient before\\nRajadithya. When I see his pride and vanity today I am greatly surprised.”\\n\\n\\x0cAdithya Karikalan intervened.\\n\\n“Thatha, why should you worry about Sambuvaraiyar’s pride? You tell me about\\nthe war at Thakkolam. How did the vast army gathered at the banks of river\\nKedilam leave this place? Why did our army face defeat in spite of the vast\\narrangements and meticulous planning? Rajadithya was one of the greatest\\nwarriors of our times. And he was heading such a mighty army. How did the\\nenemy manage to defeat them at Thakkolam? I know, Thatha, you also took part\\nin the war. You must have seen what happened at the great battle field.”\\n\\n“Yes, my child. I was there. I was about to describe the scene.”\\n\\n“Rajadithya gathered a vast army here. He also went to distant places to train the\\nsoldiers. Due to some reason which I do not remember now he could not leave\\nthe place as planned. Meanwhile we got the news that there was a war in\\nSrilanka. A part of the army had to go there. When there was a strong enemy in\\nthe South the Chozha Emperor did not want the Chozha Generals and the\\nsoldiers go farther in the North. The Emperor suggested that the army could\\nleave after the Lankan war was over. Rajadithya did not want to go against the\\nwords of his father, the then Chozha Emperor. He waited patiently for the\\nLankan war to end. But the enemies were not patient. The King of the Twin\\nProvinces, Kannara Thevan, came with a huge army to invade the Chozha\\nKingdom. As he travelled south to invade us, Boothukan, the Kanga King joined\\nforces with him. Those were two huge armies. At a glance it looked as if the\\nNorth and the South seas merged into one great ocean eager to swallow the\\nChozha Kingdom. In that vast ocean of their army there were many, many giant\\nwhales, I mean the elephants, and many sharks, I mean the horses. At one time it\\nappeared that the vast ocean would drown the entire Chozha Kingdom, as the\\nseas would swallow the earth at the time of apocalypse. Our spies ran all the way\\nup here to break the devastating news of invasion.\\n\\n“Even that happened for good, said Emperor Paranthaka. If our armies had\\n\\n\\x0ctravelled up north to fight the enemy they would have been fatigued by the long\\njourney and would have lost the enthusiasm to fight. That way it was better to\\nface the enemy in the home ground. It was easy to corner them on all the four\\nsides and vanquish them in our homeland. The Emperor allowed us to travel\\nonly when we got the news that the enemy’s army had reached Thirupathi.\\n\\n“Rajadithya was raring to go. And the moment he got the Emperor’s permission\\nhe headed a huge army up North. The army consisted of three hundred thousand\\ninfantrymen, fifty thousand horsemen, ten thousand elephants, two thousand\\nchariots, three hundred and twenty generals and thirty two Chieftains. I was\\nfortunate to be one of them; and was unfortunate to come back alive.\\n\\nAfter three days of travel the armies clashed against each other at a place called\\nThakkolam which was two miles north from Kanchi.\\n\\n“Adithya, we have heard about the war between Devendra and Vrithirasura in\\nour mythology. We also know about the Rama - Ravana war and the Pandava Kaurava war. But those who saw the Thakkolam war would say that the\\nmythological wars were nothing but small skirmishes. We were outnumbered in\\nthe ratio of one to two. I came to know later that the army of the enemy had five\\nhundred thousand infantry men and thirty thousand trained elephants. So what?\\nThere was no one on the enemy side who was half as valiant as your ancestor\\nRajadithya. So the Goddess of Valour and the Goddess of Victory were clearly\\non our side.\\n\\n“The war lasted for ten days. It was difficult even to take a count of the soldiers\\nwho lost their lives in the war. Dead elephants resembling black hillocks were\\nscattered all over the battle field. Both the sides had lost heavily. But the\\nenemy’s side became weak quite soon. The enemies soon found out the reason.\\nWherever Rajadithya’s elephant went proudly displaying the Tiger flag, the\\nGoddess of Victory was following suit. Whenever a section of our army felt\\ndisheartened Rajadithya would go there along with his elephant. As soon as the\\n\\n\\x0csoldiers saw the huge beast and the greatest warrior of our times sitting on it,\\nthey became excited and attacked the enemy with three times\\' greater ferocity\\nthan what they did before.\\n\\nThe enemies who were closely following the events of the war hatched a mean\\nconspiracy. We came to know of it only much later. The person who hatched the\\nconspiracy and the one who executed it was none other than the Kanga King,\\nBoothukan. Suddenly the treacherous king hoisted the white flag of peace on his\\nelephant, lifted both his hands above his head and approached our army\\nrepeating the words, “surrender” again and again. Rajadithya was near him. I\\nthink he must have done that only after seeing Rajadithya’s elephant.\\nRajadithya’s heart melted when he saw the enemy king surrendering to him. He\\nwanted to know whether the King of the Twin Provinces himself wants to stop\\nthe war or was the Kanga King parting ways to save him.\\n\\nHe blew his conch. He ordered his body guards to stand away. He asked the\\nenemy king Boothukan to approach his elephant. Boothukan kept his hands\\nfolded till he approached Rajadithya. Rajadithya even saw tears in his eyes. His\\nheart melted more.\\n\\nThe greatest warrior of his times, the one and only Rajadithya forgot the sane\\nadvice given by the great Tamil sage Thiruvalluvar - “Hidden inside the hands of\\nan enemy folded in supplication will be a weapon to kill; even an enemy’s tears\\nare of the same kind.”\\n\\nRajadithya was moved by the enemy’s tears. So he let Boothukan come very\\nclose to him and asked him, “What is the news?” Boothukan’s response made\\nRajadithya hate him.\\n\\nThe treacherous king told him that he knew for sure that the armies of the Twin\\n\\n\\x0cProvinces would be crushed in the encounter. Hence he advised Kannara Devan\\nto surrender to the Chozha forces. Since Kannara Devan refused he came alone\\nto surrender. Rajadithya was furious.\\n\\nHe told him that he would never have such a traitor on his side. He advised him\\nto go back to his side and fight on the side of his ally, Kannara Devan. As\\nRajadithya was talking Boothukan committed the meanest treachery ever\\nrecorded in the history of Kings. He took out this bow and shot a poisoned arrow\\ninto the chest of Rajadithya. The great Chozha warrior fell down. Nobody was\\nprepared for that mean act of betrayal from Boothukan. The Chozha warriors\\nand Rajadithya’s bodyguards could not understand what happened. Everything\\nhappened in a flash. They heard Rajadithya telling the enemy king to go back to\\nhis side. The next moment they saw Boothukan driving his elephant hard to run\\naway from the scene.\\n\\nRajadithya died while remaining seated on the elephant. It was the most\\ndevastating news for our army. It was as if a giant lightning had struck every\\nsoldier in the army. The grief of our army was so much that for a moment they\\nsimply forgot to fight. Chieftains, generals and soldiers stopped fighting and\\nstarted wailing. No wonder the enemy gained an upper hand. Very soon our\\narmy was forced to retreat from the war. And it was quite easy to drive away an\\narmy which was fleeing the battle field. I am ashamed to say that I was one of\\nthose who fled the battle at that time. The enemy’s army had reached up to the\\nbanks of River Kedilam.\\n\\nWe regained our consciousness only when we reached here. I took my family\\nfrom Thirukkovalur and left them at my fort in Malainadu. I started gathering an\\narmy on the slopes of the mountains. I came back here every now and then to\\ndrive away the enemy forces that had set up their base here. Even then the\\nenemy did not leave this place for a long time. They stayed here and were quite a\\nnuisance to our Kingdom. Kanchi was under their control. Three years ago you\\nkilled Veerapandiyan and came here to reclaim the city of Kanchi.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Thatha, I know the entire history. Even then I love to hear about Rajadithya’s\\nstory again and again. It never ceases to amaze me. But tell me this, Thatha.\\nWhy did you remind me now of Rajadithya?”\\n\\n“My Child, your grandfather’s brother, Rajadithya wanted to extend the Chozha\\nEmpire up to the banks of River Ganges. He died without realizing his dream.\\nNow the whole Kingdom says that my grandson is no less than his illustrious\\nancestor Rajadithya. People are saying that you are going to fulfil Rajadithya’s\\ndreams. I don’t want you to fall to treachery as he did. That’s why I reminded\\nyou of his story.\\n\\n“Thatha! My grandfather’s brother lost his life because of a mean conspiracy.\\nWhy do you remind me of that story? After all I am not going to war. I am not\\ngoing to the enemy’s place to be betrayed. I am just going to see my father’s\\nfriends. I don’t think they’ll cheat me, Thatha.”\\n\\n“Listen to me, my child. Our sage Thiruvalluvar said that there might be an arm\\nhidden inside the hands folded in supplication or in the tears of an enemy. The\\nsame sage says elsewhere that the internal enmity is more dangerous than the\\nexternal one.\\n\\n‘You need not fear the enemy who like a sword is coming to attack you; but\\nbeware of the enemy in the guise of a friend.’\\n\\n“My Child, you are now going in the midst of your enemies who are hiding\\nunder the cloak of friendship. I have tried my best to stop you. But you won’t\\nlisten. They have called you to mediate on a dispute concerning the Chozha\\nKingdom. I also learn that they are planning to get one of Sambuvaraiyar’s\\ndaughters married to you. But I still do not know what their real intentions are.\\nYou also do not know. There are many kings in this great country dying to give\\n\\n\\x0ctheir daughters to you in marriage. You do not need this Sambuvaraiyar’s\\ndaughter for your career. I also learn that they are going to divide the Chozha\\nEmpire into two and give one half to you, while the other half goes to your uncle\\nMadhuranthakan. I don’t know what kind of scam will be there in that Partition\\nPlan. Whatever it may be I am going back to Thirukkovalur and will come back\\nwith my guards to wait for you at the banks of River Vellaru. When you are\\nstaying at Sambuvaraiyar’s palace if you suspect anybody or anything, send\\nword to me.”\\n\\nThe old King knew that that Adithya Karikalan had not been listening to him.\\nHis attention was elsewhere.\\n\\n“Thatha! Look there.” Adithya Karikalan spoke with trepidation. The valiant old\\nman looked in the direction pointed out by him.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 3 - The Falcon And The Dove\\n\\nAdithya Karikalan pointed to a Mandapam. The Mandapam was made of stone.\\nSome philanthropist might have built it for the convenience of the travellers. It\\nprovided shelter from the sun and rain. The structure was old and the outer walls\\nclearly exhibited the signs of ageing. There were some sculpted images near the\\nentrance of the Mandapam. The old man, Malaiyaman, could not see them with\\nhis failing eye sight.\\n\\n“Do you see that, Thatha?”\\n\\n“You mean the Mandapam, my child? I don’t see anything special about it. The\\nMandapam looks empty to me. Nobody is in there.”\\n\\n“I now know for sure that you’ve become old, Thatha. Your eyes are failing. See\\nthere. Don’t you see a falcon? Oh My God! How huge it is! See how broad its\\nwings are. But what a cruelty, Thatha! It’s holding a small dove in its legs. The\\nsharp nails of the falcon are piercing the dove. The dove is bleeding. Can’t you\\nsee the blood, Thatha? What a surprise! There is another dove nearby. The\\nsecond dove is hovering near the falcon. Perhaps this is the beloved of the\\ncaptured bird. She’s flying very close to the dangerous falcon. She’s pleading for\\nher lover’s life. She’s begging the falcon to spare her lover. But wait, is the dove\\nfighting with the falcon or pleading with him? Oh My God! How bold she is!\\nShe is now trying to fight with the falcon. She is going to fight with the giantbird for her beloved’s life. But Thatha do you think that the falcon will have\\nmercy on the dove? No, it won’t. Never. It must have eaten many doves like this\\none. See the falcon’s huge body. It has eaten many doves in the past and that\\nexplains his fat body. Oh Evil Falcon! Here I am coming to kill you.”\\n\\n\\x0cAdithya Karikalan took a pebble and threw at the falcon. The pebble hit the\\nMandapam and fell down.\\n\\n“Devil! Giant! You deserve this and much more”\\n\\nAdithya Karikalan laughed in a devilish manner.\\n\\nHis grandfather Malaiyaman already had doubts about his grandson’s sanity. The\\nsuspicion got stronger now.\\n\\n“Thatha, why are you looking at me like that? For heaven’s sake please go near\\nthe Mandapam and have a look.”\\n\\nMalaiyaman went near the Mandapam and looked at the place where Karikalan’s\\nstone had fallen. He saw a sculpture there. A falcon was holding a dove in its\\nlegs. Another dove was fighting with the falcon. The sculpture looked very real.\\n\\nMalaiyaman returned to his grandson.\\n\\n“Yes, my child. I’ve become old. My eyesight is failing. I could not see the\\nsculpture till I went near it. Good work of art.”\\n\\n“That’s too mild a word, Thatha. It’s wonderful. It’s a miracle on stone. Must\\nhave been done by some artist from the Mahendra Varman - Mamallan period.\\nAt first I thought it was not a sculpture but a real scene.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Adithya, the miracle is not just in the stone. It’s in your eyes as well. It’s in your\\nmind too. Hundreds of travellers pass through this way. Many of them would not\\nhave even cared to look at the sculpture. The rest would have just given a\\ncursory glance. Only somebody gifted like you can appreciate the art in the\\nstone.”\\n\\n“I am not appreciating, Thatha. I am not surprised. I am furious. I want to\\ndestroy the sculpture right now. I don’t want to praise the man who created such\\na cruel sculpture.”\\n\\n“What is this I am hearing, Karikala? When did your heart, which used to be as\\nstrong as a diamond, become so soft? The falcon devouring the dove is its given\\nnature. If a lion were to show compassion to sheep it won’t be a lion. It too\\nwould become a sheep. Those who want to sit on the throne have to destroy their\\nenemies and traitors. Those who want to become great Emperors and bring the\\nwhole world under their sway have to kill their enemies. If the falcon did not kill\\nthe dove how can it be a falcon? Why are you upset by its act, Karikala?”\\n\\n“Thatha, you speak the truth. But should not the falcon be compassionate after\\nseeing the lady dove pleading so passionately for her beloved? Should it not\\nrelease the dove at least for the sake of its lover? Ok, tell me this, Thatha. When\\nyou are about to kill your enemy, if his lover were to fall at your feet and beg for\\nyour mercy what will you do? Will you not show mercy on your enemy?”\\n\\n“Never Karikala, Never! If a woman comes in between I’ll just push her away\\nwith my left foot and kill my enemy. I’d have no qualms about that act. Didn’t\\nour saint Thiruvalluvar say that the enemies would carry weapons in the hands\\nfolded in supplication or in their tears? In a way a woman’s tears are more\\ndangerous than a man’s, because a woman’s tears have the powers to melt our\\nheart. And a person who lets his heart melt can’t do anything great in his life.\\n\\n\\x0cHe’ll be far worse than a woman.”\\n\\n“Thatha, why are you degrading women? That would be an insult to my mother,\\nwho is a woman and who also happens to be your daughter.”\\n\\n“Listen, my child. The love I have for my daughter … there is not even a pale\\ncomparison to that in this whole world. I had six sons, my child. They were all\\ngreat warriors. They were like the legendary Bheema and Arjuna. But alas, I lost\\nthem all in the battle-field. I was never sad when I heard about the death of my\\ndear sons. But when your mother got married and went away from me to adorn\\nthe Chozha throne ... Oh my God ... I was devastated. But I did not show my\\nfeelings. Not even to my daughter, my child. Do you know what I told your\\nmother before her marriage? I said:\\n\\n’Daughter dearest, you are going to marry an emperor. Don’t be proud on that\\naccount. Marrying such a famous king will only add to your woes. Many of your\\nmaids will be far happier than you. Prepare yourself for a life of grief and\\nmisery. If you don’t bear children to your husband he will marry other women.\\nYou should never grieve for that, my dear.\\n\\nIf sons are born to you, bring them up as warriors. And if you hear that your\\nsons died in the battlefield you should not shed tears for them. If your husband is\\nhappy, be happy. If your husband is sad then go out of the way to make him\\nhappy. If your husband is sick, you should attend on him. And if he dies then you\\ndie with him. Even if your heart bleeds you should never shed tears.\\n\\nThis is how the women from the Malaiyaman clan live.’\\n\\n\\x0c“That was the advice I gave to my daughter, to your mother when she got\\nmarried. I am proud to say that my daughter has never gone against my advice so\\nfar. Karikala, she has brought you and your brother up as matchless warriors.\\nEver since your father fell ill, she has been by his side night and day attending to\\nhim. I am really proud to have that gem as my daughter, Karikala.”\\n\\n“Thatha, whenever I think of my mother, my heart bursts in pride. But let me ask\\nyou one thing. Let’s say my father is being held by his worst enemy. Let’s say\\nhe’s going to kill him. He’s coming near him with a drawn sword. What will my\\nmother do then? Will she beg the enemy to spare her husband’s life? Especially\\nwhen the enemy is someone known to her?”\\n\\n“My child! Your mother will never beg for her husband’s life. And that too from\\nan enemy. Malaiyaman’s daughter will never insult the clan she was born in or\\nthe clan she was married into. She’ll consider her husband’s enemy as her\\nenemy. And if her husband dies she’ll fall on him and die too. Or else she’ll\\nharden her heart and decide to live. And if she did so, it will be for the sole\\npurpose of revenging her husband’s death.”\\n\\nAdithya Karikalan let out a long sigh.\\n\\n“Can I go now, Thatha?”\\n\\n“Is it absolutely necessary that should you go?”\\n\\n“Do you still have doubts, Thatha? We have come more than half way.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Yes, we have. I first asked you not to go. Then I changed my mind. After\\nhearing about your brother I thought its better that you go. But I don’t think\\nArulmozhivarman would have died.”\\n\\n“Nor do I.”\\n\\n“When your father was young, we did not know where he was for some time. It\\nwas only much later that our soldiers found him in an island in Srilanka.\\nSimilarly Arulmozhi must be in some island. He is sure to come back after some\\ntime. But then the news of his death has made the Chozha country erupt into a\\nfury. Your parents must also be in a state of grief. This is the time you should be\\nwith them and offer solace. When you go there it’s better to go as a friend of\\nPazhuvettaraiyars rather than as their enemy. That’s the only reason I let you\\naccept Sambuvaraiyar’s invitation. He has deliberately avoided me. If I had been\\ninvited I would have surely come along with you.”\\n\\n“Do you fear for my safety? Do you think I am an imbecile?”\\n\\n“No, Karikala! Never! I know your valour. I won’t think twice to send you in the\\nmidst of an enemy army consisting of ten thousand men armed to their teeth. But\\nI tremble in fear to send you before a cunning woman who is shedding tears to\\ndistract your attention.”\\n\\n“I don’t think Sambuvaraiyar’s daughter is that cunning. I hear that she is a timid\\ngirl who is afraid to come in the presence of men. Kandhanmaran has told me.\\nLet me make one thing very clear, Thatha. I am not that rash to marry a girl\\nwithout getting my parents’ blessings. I also know that there are two women in\\nyour own clan waiting to be married off.”\\n\\n\\x0c“I never thought of that, Karikala. My eldest son has two daughters. But I have\\nno idea of burdening you with them. Already the Chieftains of Chozha Kingdom\\nare burning in jealousy because my daughter is married to the reigning Emperor.\\nAnd that jealousy has grown into enmity. And if this too happens then they will\\njoin forces to invade my country. I’ll be happy if you marry Sambuvaraiyar’s\\ndaughter. You see, I have become old. My body has become weak. At times I\\nfeel that weakness in my mind too. I even wonder whether this will be the last\\ntime I see you. Perhaps it is. I don’t think I can help you any longer. You need\\nsome new friends for sure. You need people who are interested in your welfare.\\nHence I’d be very happy if you marry Sambuvaraiyar’s daughter.”\\n\\n“Thatha, I can’t do that even for your happiness. I am going to Sambuvaraiyar’s\\npalace as a guest not to seek his friendship. Or to marry his daughter. You can be\\npeaceful.”\\n\\n“Then why should you go my child? Why don’t you tell me the truth? I\\noverheard your friends’ conversation. I heard that the devil whom the Senior\\nPazhuvettaraiyar has married has sent you a message. And you are going to\\nKadambur only for that reason.”\\n\\n“You are right, Thatha.”\\n\\n“Oh My God! What times are we in? The Chozha clan in which you are born has\\na two-thousand year old tradition. Some of your ancestors had brought the whole\\nworld under their rule. At times they were mere chieftains who ruled over the\\ncity of Uraiyur and its surroundings. Some were like Lord Ram, faithfully\\nwedded to a single woman all their lives. Some married many women and gave\\nbirth to many warriors. Some worshipped Lord Shiva and some Lord Vishnu.\\nSome were staunch atheists. But every one of them had a blemish-less character.\\nThey never indulged in anything scandalous. They have never fallen for others’\\nwives. My child, you can marry as many virgins as you want. Your grandfather’s\\nfather - Emperor Paranthaka - married seven women. You can be like him.\\n\\n\\x0cNobody can raise their finger against you. But never look at that devilish woman\\nwho is married to the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar.”\\n\\n“Forgive me, Thatha. I’ll never do anything of that sort. I’ll never bring\\nignominy to the Chozha clan or the Malaiyaman clan.\\n\\n“Then why did you accept her invitation, my child?”\\n\\n“Let me tell the truth at least to you. Once I did her a grievous wrong. I am going\\nto seek her pardon.”\\n\\n“What words, Karikala? How can you beg the pardon of a woman? I can’t bear\\nto hear those words.”\\n\\nFor a while Karikalan hung down his head remaining silent. Then he gathered\\ncourage and told his grandfather everything. He spoke about how he searched\\nfor Veerapandiyan and how Nandini begged for his life and how he mercilessly\\nkilled him and how he had been suffering since that day.\\n\\n“That memory is torturing me, Thatha. I won’t be peaceful unless I see her once\\nand seek her forgiveness. It appears that she is ready to forgive me. She is also\\ninterested in avoiding succession problems in the Chozha Empire. She has called\\nme only for that purpose. I’ll finish my work and come back to Kanchi very\\nsoon. And once I come back I’ll take a ship to search for my brother in the seven\\nseas of this world.”\\n\\n\\x0cThe old man sighed.\\n\\n“Many things are becoming clear to me. Whatever appeared mysterious earlier is\\nnow very clear. One thing is very sure, my child. Nobody can win over Destiny.”\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 4 - The Ayyanar Temple\\n\\nWhen Adithya Karikalan was in conversation with his grandfather on the banks\\nof River Kedilam Azhwarkkadian and Vandhiya Thevan were engaged in a\\nstrange mission at a place called Thirukkanaattumullur on the Northern Banks of\\nRiver Coleroon.\\n\\nIn those days Coleroon, otherwise known as North Cauvery, was considered as\\nmuch a holy river as its counterpart, the Southern Cauvery. In the Tamil month\\nof Aippasi (corresponding to October-November of the English Calendar) Lord\\nShiva, the principal deity of the temple was in Thirukkanaattumullur would\\ncome in a procession riding on the traditional bull to the river banks to give\\ndharshan to his devotees. Every afternoon will be festival time during the whole\\nof that month. People from the nearby villages would gather there for the\\noccasion.\\n\\nThe town had a small Vishnu temple as well. Lord Vishnu also would come in\\nprocession to the banks of Coleroon riding on his vehicle, Garuda, the bird.\\n\\nThat was the first day of the month and people had gathered in large numbers to\\ntake a holy dip in the river. Azhwarkkadian planted a branch of a Jamun tree on\\nthe banks and challenged the visitors to a wordy duel.\\n\\n“CHALLENGE! CHALLENGE! I have come here to establish the supremacy of\\nthe religion of Vaishnavism in this island. Saivites, Buddhists, Advaitins,\\nKapalikas, Kalamukas, Jains and Sakthas... I invite you to a debate. If you win\\nI’ll bear you on my shoulders and go all over the town. And if you lose you’ll\\nhave to give whatever you have. I’ll let you wear only a small piece of cloth on\\n\\n\\x0cyour waist. You’ll have to give everything else to me. CHALLENGE!\\nCHALLENGE”\\n\\nLying before him were heaps of rosary beads, the vessels used by the sages, earjewels, silk cloth and gold coins. Anybody could infer that he must have been\\narguing for a long time. And must have had a continuous streak of victories.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan stood close to him leaning on a Kadamba tree. He was dressed\\nonly up to his waist. And was holding an unsheathed sword in his hand. From\\nhis appearance and posture one could easily guess that he had been using his\\nsword to frighten away those who tried to use violence to win the wordy duel\\nwith Azhwarkkadian. And that was made clear by the words he spoke to a group\\nof noisy Saivites.\\n\\n“I warn you. You are welcome to have a debate with this man. But anybody who\\nresorts to violence, anybody who tries to touch this man will become a prey to\\nmy sword.”\\n\\nHe swirled the sword twice to demonstrate his intentions. The Saivites who were\\nan angry mob only a few seconds ago became silent and peaceful.\\n\\nOne of them shouted at Azhwarkkadian:\\n\\n“Oh Vaishnavite! Don’t be too proud of your victories. Go to Thirunaaraiyur.\\nThere you’ll meet Nambiyandaar Nambi who will defeat you in the debate and\\nmake you run for your life.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Ask your Thirunaaraiyur Nambi to argue with Anandha Bhattar of\\nThirunarayanapuram...” Azhwarkkadian shot back.\\n\\nAzhwarkkadian shouted “CHALLENGE” “CHALLENGE” several times. This\\ntime there were no takers. He removed the branch of the Jamun tree and planted\\nin its stead a victory flag which had the Vaishnavite symbols of the conch and\\nthe disc. Some Vaishnavites had been watching his actions. When they saw the\\nvictory flag they all ran to him, lifted him on their shoulders and hailed his\\nvictory.\\n\\n“Narayana is our Lord. Come let’s worship him.”\\n\\nThey started dancing around him singing the same refrain.\\n\\nThere was a competition among them in inviting Azhwarkkadian for lunch at\\ntheir homes. Azhwarkkadian accepted the invitation and told them in a majestic\\nvoice. “Yes, we’ll come to your place for food.”\\n\\nHe took Vandhiya Thevan with him. They had tamarind rice, curd rice and a\\nsweet porridge. The dishes were so delicious that they had their stomachs filled\\nup. Azhwarkkadian surveyed the spoils of his debating game. He retained a\\npiece of silk cloth and gave all the rest to the Vaishnavites and requested them to\\npay whatever they considered to be the worth of those things. He told them that\\nhe was keen on establishing the supremacy of Vaishnavism and for that purpose\\ntravelling up North up to Haridwar. And therefore he needed gold coins for the\\ntravel. The Vaishnavites were pleased and gave him more gold than what those\\nthings were worth.\\n\\n\\x0cAzhwarkkadian and Vandhiya Thevan took leave of their hosts and left for\\nKadambur.\\n\\nRiver Coleroon was in floods at that time. They used a boat to cross the river.\\nThey had to leave their horses behind. The boat was overcrowded. It capsized\\nwhen it was about to reach the bank. Vandhiya Thevan had to swim along with\\nthe other passengers. In the process he lost his waist band which he had been\\npreserving for years. The waist band had some signet rings and the message\\ngiven by Princess Kunthavai. They were all washed away. He also lost the gold\\ncoins. In fact they had planned the strategy of a religious debate only earn\\nmoney to buy horses for their travel. Of course their strategy had worked and\\nthey had money. But they could not buy horses anywhere in the vicinity. Horses\\nmight be available for sale in the weekly market in Kadambur. Or else they had\\nto travel all the way up to Thiruppathiripulliyur for buying horses.\\n\\nThe friends debated whether they should now go to Kadambur or not. They\\nlisted out the pros and cons of travelling up to Kadambur. They might get some\\nnews about Adithya Karikalan’s travel plans. They might know whether the\\nCrown Prince had left Kanchi and the route taken by him. But they should not be\\nseen by anybody known to them in Kadambur. It would be a disaster if they met\\nKandhanmaran at Kadambur. And if Pazhuvettaraiyar’s retinue had reached\\nKadambur already then their staying in that place would be highly risky.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan opened the conversation.\\n\\n“Vaishnava, you know how to scale a wall. Why don’t you bring two horses\\nfrom Sambuvaraiyar’s stable?”\\n\\n“Yes, I can scale a wall. But, my friend, I don’t think Sambuvaraiyar’s horses\\ncan. And that’s the problem.”\\n\\n\\x0c“If Pazhuvur’s retinue is there we can steal two horses from them. Once they\\ndrove away my horse. I want to take revenge.”\\n\\nThen they started talking about their earlier meeting at Kadambur and the\\nmysterious happenings of that eventful night.\\n\\nThey reached Kadambur at sunset. Kadambur, as they expected, was abuzz with\\nactivity. The Palace and the main entrance to the Fort were decorated with\\nfestoons. Security was tight around the main gate and along the walls of the\\nFort. After all, the Crown Prince of the Chozha Kingdom was paying a visit.\\nAdded to that, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Pazhuvettaraiyar along with his\\nwife the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur was also paying a visit. These dignitaries\\nwould come with a large retinue. The town would be in a festive mood for some\\ndays.\\n\\nThe two friends heard the people talking about all these things in the streets of\\nKadambur. From what they heard they could infer that none of the dignitaries\\nhad yet arrived. They also learned that Kandhanmaran, son of Sambuvaraiyar,\\nhad gone all the way to Kanchi to escort Adithya Karikalan safely to Kadambur.\\nIn the midst of the excitement surrounding the visit of the Crown Prince the two\\nfriends also heard some people talking about the ‘drowned prince’ in a hushed\\nvoice. When such a great tragedy had struck the nation it was not somehow right\\nto have this feasts and festivals.\\n\\nAzhwarkkadian and Vandhiya Thevan heard what the people talked. But they did\\nnot evince any interest in the conversation. They crossed the town. They did not\\nwant to stay in the town for the night. They were scouting for a Mandapam in\\nruins or an abandoned inn somewhere in the outskirts of the city. In the extreme\\ncase of their not finding any such place they planned to go to\\nVeeranarayanapuram and stay there for the night. They could peacefully sleep in\\n\\n\\x0cthe 100-pillared-Mandapam of the Vishnu Temple. After what they experienced\\nthe previous night they were badly in need of a good night’s sleep.\\n\\nAs they crossed the city limits they saw a dense bamboo forest and an Ayyanar\\nTemple inside the forest.\\n\\n“Vaishnava, I can’t walk even a step more. Let’s stay in the temple for the night.\\nThis is the best place to keep away from the eyes of people.”\\n\\n“You are wrong, young man. What’s the guarantee that persons like us would not\\nchoose this place for the night stay?”\\n\\n“If such people come with horses it will be all the more better.”\\n\\n“No horse can enter this bamboo forest. Even men will find it difficult to come\\nin.”\\n\\n“There has to be a way somewhere. It could be just a single track. There has to\\nbe a way for the temple priest to reach the temple.”\\n\\nThe two men were walking in circle around the bamboo bushes. At last they\\nfound out a narrow single-track path in the middle of dense growth. It was no\\nmean achievement to walk through the path without being hurt by the thorns in\\nthe bush. After walking for a few minutes they arrived at a clearing. There was a\\nsmall Ayyanar temple. There was a small altar in front of the temple. Images of\\nelephants and horses made of mud were found near the altar. It was the custom\\n\\n\\x0cof the devotees to gift such images to god if their prayers were answered.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan was in a mood to tease.\\n\\n“Why should we worry about horses? Why can’t we borrow two from Ayyanar\\nhimself?”\\n\\n“Haven’t you heard the Tamil proverb that one should not get into a river relying\\non a mud horse?”\\n\\n“Vaishnava, our Ayyanar is a powerful god. He would grant our prayers\\nimmediately. He is not like your Vishnu who would make his devotees, suffer,\\nwait and yearn while he sleeps in day time.”\\n\\n“Then do you mean to say that your God will breathe life into these mud horses?\\nWell, that will be a real blessing. It will save us a lot of money.”\\n\\n“If your devotion is real even mud horses will come to life. Tell me what is our\\nbody? It’s made of sand and Lord Brahma breathed life into it.”\\n\\n“Well said. We quite often forget that this body is made of mud. It is only to\\nremind that basic fact that we make a paste of the holy sand and apply it on our\\nbodies as religious symbols. That’s what our Vaishnavite Acharyas have ordered\\nus to do.”\\n\\n\\x0cVandhiya Thevan whispered “ssh ... “and held Azhwarkkadian’s hand and\\npointed out at a distance. The sun had set a little earlier. Darkness was slowly\\nsetting in the bamboo forest. In the fading light it appeared as if Ayyanar’s mud\\nhorses had come to life and were moving. An elephant and a horse shifted\\nplaces. Vandhiya Thevan did not know whether to believe the miracle happening\\nright before his eyes. At the same time he did not want to miss the chance of\\nshowing Ayyanar’s divine powers to Azhwarkkadian.\\n\\n“Vaishnava, can you see what’s happening?”\\n\\nBefore he finished the sentence Azhwarkkadian gripped his hand hard and\\nplaced a finger on his lips asking him to maintain absolute silence. Then without\\ntaking off his hand he led Vandhiya Thevan to a safe hiding place behind the\\nbushes.\\n\\nThe elephant and the horse moved a little creating a space between them. A\\nman’s head appeared in the space. The head turned in all the four directions. It\\nwas a ghastly sight to see a human head very near the altar turning in all the\\ndirections. Vandhiya Thevan who had seen many ghastly sights in his life\\nshivered in fear. But the firm Azhwarkkadian’s hands gave him reassurance.\\nVandhya Thevan felt protected.\\n\\nAs they were watching, the head moved up a little more. Now they could see up\\nto the man’s chest. Then they saw the whole man. The place from which he\\nemerged did not look like a hole in the ground. It appeared as the dark passage to\\nthe nether world.\\n\\nThe friends recognised the man in a few seconds. He was a part of Ravidasan’s\\nconspiracy gang while apparently working for the Kadambur Palace. He was\\nIdumbankari.\\n\\n\\x0cThe two friends recognised him at the same time and looked at each other\\nexchanging meaningful glances. Idumbankari did not make any attempt to cover\\nthe hole through which he came. He looked around a few more times and then\\nstarted walking towards the Ayyanar Temple. He opened the door of the temple\\nand walked in. A few minutes later they could see a dim flickering light in the\\ntemple. They inferred that a lamp inside the temple had been lit.\\n\\n“Thambi what do you think of this?” Azhwarkkadian asked in a whisper.\\n\\n“I think Ayyanar is a powerful god. Didn’t you see the horse coming to life?”\\n\\n“That’s okay. What do you think of the man we just saw?”\\n\\n“Should be the temple priest. Come, let’s go in and pray.”\\n\\n“Wait. Let’s see if somebody else comes to pray.”\\n\\n“Do you think anybody else will come?”\\n\\n“Then why should he light the lamp?”\\n\\n“What’s the big deal in a priest lighting a lamp at the temple?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Thambi, can’t you recognise him?”\\n\\n“Why not? He’s the one who got me a horse at the banks of Southern banks of\\nColeroon. Yes, he is Idumbankari. I think I can ask him to get me a horse now.”\\n\\n“Good Idea.”\\n\\n“Why, you don’t like it?”\\n\\n“Idumbankari is a part of Ravidasan’s gang.”\\n\\n“Then I have a better idea.”\\n\\n“What? What?”\\n\\n“While Idumbankari is busy serving God let me find out from where he\\nappeared all of a sudden.”\\n\\n“How is that possible?”\\n\\n“Can’t I look into the hole from which he came out?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Possible. But the risks... “\\n\\n“There is nothing worthwhile which is not risky.”\\n\\n“It’s your call.”\\n\\n“Vaishnavite, you be here and find out what’s happening.”\\n\\n“That’s not a problem. Do you have any idea where this tunnel goes?”\\n\\n“Yes, I do. I want to test my hypothesis.”\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\n“It might be useful sometime. Who knows?”\\n\\nThey heard some voices at a distance.\\n\\n“We can’t wait any longer. I am sure you’ll be here till I come back. Or will you\\nditch me in the same way Sugriva ditched his brother Vali when the latter went\\ninto a cave to fight with a demon?”\\n\\n\\x0c“I’ll be here as long as I am alive. But what’s the guarantee you’ll return?”\\n\\n“I’ll return if I am alive.”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan reached the hole in a few giant steps. And jumped in. The next\\nsecond he vanished. For a second it appeared as if the gaping hole swallowed\\nhim alive.\\n\\nIdumbankari came out of the temple. He saw the open hole. He went near the\\naltar and rotated the trident which appeared to be embedded on the temple floor.\\n\\nThe mud elephant and the horse which had moved away earlier came closer\\nagain. The hole disappeared. Idumbankari then moved to the entrance of the\\ntemple. At the same time Ravidasan, Soman Sambavan and others arrived there\\nfrom different directions. Azhwarkkadian hid himself behind the bamboo\\nbushes. Ravidasan sat on the steps. Others sat on the floor before him.\\n\\n“Friends, time has come to fulfil our vows.”\\n\\n“You have been saying these words for the past six months.”\\n\\n“There is nothing wrong in it. For the past six months the D-day remained very\\nclose. Now it’s even closer. It’s a matter of a few days. We have got news that\\nAdithya Karikalan has left Kanchi already. The old man from Thirukkovalur,\\nKing Malaiyaman, tried his best to stop him. I hear all his efforts failed.”\\n\\n\\x0c“What’s the guarantee he will not be stopped on the way?”\\n\\n“Adithya Karikalan will never change his mind. He won’t listen to anybody.”\\n\\n“What if the message sent by his sister reached him?”\\n\\n“How can it? We have kept him bound in the forest.”\\n\\n“Beautiful. I saw him in the northern banks of Coleroon this morning. I saw\\nanother enemy with him.”\\n\\n“Who was that?”\\n\\n“The fake Vaishnavite.”\\n\\n“Then we will have to be very careful. We should make sure that they do not\\nmeet Adithya Karikalan.”\\n\\n“That’s doing things in a roundabout way. We could have killed the messenger\\nand sealed his fate. Why did the Queen ask us to keep him alive?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Friends, I too did not understand her logic first. But later I realised that the\\nQueen is a better strategist than I. She asked us to let him live for a very\\nimportant reason. There is no need for you to know that at this point of time.\\nLet’s not bother about Vandhiya Thevan. But if you see that Vaishnavite\\nanywhere, kill him on the spot. Don’t even think.”\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 5 - The Deadly Underground Tunnel\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan entered the deadly Tunnel and walked down a few steps. Then\\nit was level ground. There was little light. He walked another ten to fifteen steps.\\nThen he heard the sound of some wheels moving. The next moment he was\\nengulfed in absolute darkness. He painfully remembered his earlier resolution of\\nnot meddling in affairs that did not concern him.\\n\\nOh My God! What is my mission? How crucial it is? Why did I neglect my work\\nand enter this tunnel? Where will this lead me to? And what dangers are waiting\\nfor me there? Why do I always end up doing something foolish every time? When\\nwill I be able to shed off my impulsive rashness?\\n\\nHe decided to abandon the venture and go back. He turned around. He could feel\\nthe steps. But he could not find the opening above him. He tried to feel with his\\nhand. It was of no use. Somebody must have closed the hole from above.\\nVandhiya Thevan was shocked. He was sweating profusely. He now tried harder\\nto open the closed hole. He could hear voices at a distance. Perhaps the voices\\ncame from the people who had come to the Ayyanar temple. Idumban Kari was\\nwaiting for somebody. His lighting the lamp at the temple must have been a\\nsignal for somebody to come there. If that was true then Vandhiya Thevan\\nfinding a way out of the tunnel at that time might be a great blunder. How long\\nwould they be at the temple? He could never know. If they were all Idumban\\nKari’s men like Ravidasan then they would talk for a long, long time. But why\\nwere they assembled there? And what were they talking about? What kind of\\nconspiracy were they hatching at the moment? The Vaishnavite fanatic must be\\nwatching them.\\n\\nThere is no point in standing here in the tunnel bathed in sweat and gasping for\\nbreath. The only sensible way is to go further down the tunnel. Having got down\\n\\n\\x0cthe tunnel let me at least find out where does it lead to.\\n\\nHaving made a firm decision Vandhiya Thevan marched forward. There was\\nlevel ground beneath his feet. But the surface was rough and bumpy. They must\\nhave hewn the tunnel through stone. He had a broad idea where the tunnel\\nwould lead him to - probably Sambuvaraiyar’s Palace. But where exactly in the\\nPalace? It might take him to the treasury. Or to the ladies’ chambers. He knew\\nthat the palaces generally had these types of secret passages. When the Palace is\\nunder siege and the Kings needed these secret passage to escape from their\\nenemies. Generally in times of danger the top priority would be to save the\\nwomen of the palace. So these tunnels usually landed in the ladies chambers.\\n\\nTo carry the treasures out of the Palace in times of crisis was at least as\\nimportant as saving the ladies. So there was an equally good chance that the\\ntunnel ended in Sambuvaraiyar’s treasury.\\n\\nIdumban Kari had used this tunnel to come out. That made the chances of\\nlanding at the treasury much brighter. These conspirators had been plundering\\nthe treasury of the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar with the help of the Junior Queen. In\\nthe same way they might have planned to rob King Sambuvaraiyar.\\n\\nBut why should they indulge in such an act when the Crown Prince and other\\nimportant people were visiting the Palace? Could they possibly have other\\nmotives as well? Vandhiya Thevan remembered what he saw and heard in\\nThiruppurambayam War Memorial. The image of the long sword with the\\nemblem of fish held by the Junior Queen flashed before his eyes. Vandhiya\\nThevan shivered. Perhaps they had a motive far more dangerous than a simple\\nrobbery. If he knew where the path led him it would be easier for him to\\nsabotage the plans of conspirators.\\n\\n\\x0cHe had been walking through the tunnel only for a few minutes. But it appeared\\na very long time because of the darkness. The ventilation was minimal. He was\\ngasping for breath. He was sweating as well. When he mentally calculated the\\ndistance between the Ayyanar Temple and the Palace he felt overwhelmed.\\n\\nThey had walked from the front gates of the palace in a roundabout way. They\\nhad to cross the streets and go through a forest. If they had come from the back\\ngates of the Palace using a direct route the distance to the Ayyanar temple would\\nhave been far less. It should be within the range of an arrow-shot from the\\nPalace. If that was true he must have reached the outer walls of the palace by\\nnow.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan’s guess was right. He could feel a sudden gush of cool air. The\\nair refreshed him. He looked up. He could see light at a distance. He could even\\nhear voices. He must be under one of the several security posts lining the walls\\nof the palace. They must have made arrangements to let in fresh air into the\\ntunnel. But the structure allowed only air to pass. It was not possible to get down\\ninto the tunnel from above. Nor was it possible to get out of the tunnel at that\\npoint.\\n\\nThe thought that he had entered the Kadambur Palace and the gush of cool air\\nfilled his mind with enthusiasm. The end of the tunnel could not be far from\\nhere. Would that be the underground treasury? Would Sambuvaraiyar keep loads\\nof gems, diamonds, pearls and gold coins in his treasury? Would he be seeing the\\nhuman skeletons in the treasury as he saw in Pazhuvettaraiyar’s palace? Would\\nthe spiders living here too have spun a web over the mounds of gold coins?\\n\\nAs Vandhiya Thevan was engrossed in this speculation, his feet felt something.\\nHe was shocked. Then he found out that they were steps and felt relieved. Yes,\\nhe was going to climb up the stairs and then see Sambuvaraiyar’s treasury. Or\\nelse it would be the ladies chambers in the palace.\\n\\n\\x0cOh My God! Then I’d be finished. Ah! I almost forgot! Kandhanmaran’s sister.\\nManimekalai. The dark beauty. She will be there.\\n\\nWhen Vandhiya Thevan remembered that at one time he had plans of marrying\\nthat girl, a smile escaped from his mouth. There was nobody to watch his\\nbeautiful smile. What if he appeared before the ladies of the Palace when they\\nwere dressing up! Vandhiya Thevan laughed.\\n\\nThe next moment his blood froze. His heart stopped beating. His eyes bulged\\nout. Oh My God! What a blood-chilling scene! He had been climbing the stairs.\\nAs soon as he reached the top, when he was sure there were no further steps, he\\nlooked around to see where he was. Hundreds and hundreds of fiery eyes were\\nstaring at him. The eyes belonged to wild beasts of the forest. At first he decided\\nto run away. He decided to retrace his steps back to the Ayyanar temple.\\n\\nBut there was no way to go. When he reached the top step he heard a sound.\\nPerhaps the tunnel closed down on its own. But what a horrible sight! So many\\nwild beasts were waiting to devour him. There were tigers, leopards, lions, bears,\\nbison, wolves, foxes and even rhinoceroses. And there were two elephants too.\\nThe animals were ready to pounce on him. But why they have not done that yet?\\nOh My God! What a huge vulture. The gigantic owl. Bats that could swallow a\\nfull human being. Was he dreaming? And there was a crocodile with its mouth\\nopen baring its lethal teeth. But crocodiles would normally be in water. This was\\ndry ground. How did the crocodile come in the midst of the wild animals?\\n\\n“Thank God!” Vandhiya Thevan shouted. For only then did he realise that the\\nbeasts around him were not alive. He remembered his friend Kandhanmaran\\ntalking about his ancestors’ passion for hunting wild animals. He also\\nremembered his friend describing the ’Hunter’s Hall’ in their palace where some\\nof the animals hunted by the members of the Royal Household were on display\\n\\n\\x0cas stuffed carcasses. Vandhiya Thevan now realised that he had just entered that\\nhall. In spite of that knowledge, it took some time for his body to stop shivering.\\n\\nHe went to every animal and touched it. He tried to move them. He even tried to\\nkick them. Thus he made sure that none of the animals were alive. Then he\\nstarted planning his course of action. The way through which he came had been\\nsealed. Should he go back and find the way out? Or should he try to find out\\nwhere was this Hunters’ Hall located in the Kadambur Palace? Or should he\\nattempt to find if the way led to some other chamber of the Palace? He searched\\nthe walls in vain for possible exit points. With the passing of time Vandhiya\\nThevan became more and more furious. Why the hell did I venture into this\\npointless exercise and get trapped?\\n\\nAs he was walking along the walls he saw the face of an elephant embedded on\\nthe wall. The face had a trunk and the tusks.\\n\\n“Go to hell, damned elephant! It was because you started moving that I got\\ntrapped in this underground dungeon.”\\n\\nHe shouted at the dead elephant. The elephant remained silent. Even living\\nelephants would have talked back. How can the stuffed carcass of an elephant\\nrespond to his question? It did not even move its trunk.\\n\\n“Why are you silent? Didn’t you hear my question?”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan firmly held the tusks and turned them around. The next\\nmoment a miracle happened there. As soon as the tusks were turned one of the\\nelephant’s ear moved. It then folded and showed a gaping hole in the wall.\\n\\n\\x0cVandhiya Thevan was surprised beyond words. He put his face into the hole and\\nlooked around.\\n\\nHe saw a young lady’s face. The lady was dark and beautiful. Her large eyes\\nwere wide open. Surprise of surprises! He saw his own face next to the woman’s\\nface; close enough to be able to kiss her.\\n\\nThe woman’s eyes - which were wide open - opened wider still and expressed a\\nfeeling of surprise which could not be transcribed in words. There was also a\\nlittle fear in that expression. She paused briefly and she moved her red, pearly\\nlips and shouted “Kooooooooooo”.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan was shocked. He instinctively took his hands off the elephant’s\\ntusks. The next minute, the small gaping hole became the wall. There was no\\nhole, no woman. Nor could he hear the “Kooooooooooooo” sound which\\nresembled the sound of a group of beetles. It took some time for Vandhiya\\nThevan to become his normal self.\\n\\nHe started thinking about the frightening scene he just witnessed.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 6 - Manimekalai\\n\\nManimekalai, the darling daughter of King Sambuvaraiyar had always been a\\npampered child. Her father, mother and her elder brother Kandhanmaran\\nshowered their love on her. She was virtually a despot in Sambuvaraiyar’s\\nPalace. Her slightest whims became the unwritten law within the four walls of\\nthe Palace. Till very recently Manimekalai’s life was made up of song, dance and\\nsheer happiness. She had her first setback in life only a few months ago. Her\\npeople forced her to do something which she strongly detested. She had been\\ntrying hard to teach the elders in her family a basic lesson of life - ‘Obstinacy\\nnever helps’. She failed miserably.\\n\\nFor the past two years whenever her brother Kandhanmaran returned from war\\nhe would tell her about Vandhiya Thevan. He would sing praises of his valour,\\nhis brave acts of war and his intelligence. He used to tell her that Vandhiya\\nThevan was as handsome as the Love God himself, as valiant as the legendary\\nKing Arjuna of Mahabharata and as great a strategist as Lord Krishna himself.\\n\\n“He is the right man for you. He is the one who can break you, tame you and rid\\nyou of all your monkey business.”\\n\\nManimekalai loved to hear about Vandhiya Thevan. But she would feign anger\\nin her voice and fight with her brother.\\n\\n“Why do you keep raving about him all the time? Bring him here one day. Let\\nme see how good he is.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Done, sis.”\\n\\nManimekalai started seeing Vandhiya Thevan through the eyes of her fertile\\nimagination. She talked to him, laughed with him, played with him, fought with\\nhim and then reconciled too - all in the grand castle built in her mind. She was\\nliving with him in the hassle-free world of imagination. At times she would\\ndescribe him to her close friends. Four months ago her dream-castle and her\\ndreams were destroyed by the turn of events.\\n\\nKandhanmaran’s tone and voice were way different now.\\n\\n“Vandhiya Thevan has no home, no post and no status. Forget that orphan,\\nSister.”\\n\\nHe told her that his mission was to see her as the Chozha Empress sitting on the\\nfamous Thanjavur Throne. He revealed his plans to her.\\n\\nMadhuranthakan, an heir apparent to the Chozha throne, had already married the\\ndaughter of Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar. Kandhanmaran told his sister that she had to\\nbecome Madhuranthakan’s second wife. He was sure that Madhuranthakan was\\ngoing to be the next Chozha Emperor. And if only Manimekalai married him she\\ncould be the Empress of all the three worlds. Perhaps the child born of her might\\nbecome the Emperor one day. Manimekalai’s parents endorsed Kandhanmaran’s\\nwords.\\n\\nBut Manimekalai was boiling. Even without being seen by her Vandhiya Thevan\\nhad stolen her heart. She could not think of anybody else in his place.\\n\\n\\x0cManimekalai knew that Madhuranthakan was a coward who had never seen a\\nbattlefield in his life. Till very recently he had been smearing holy ash all over\\nhis body, wearing beads on his neck and telling the world that one day he was\\ngoing to become a saint.\\n\\nThis could be pardoned. But the unpardonable fact was that he had already been\\nmarried. Manimekalai had learnt that the women of the Thanjavur Palace are\\nvery proud. They thought they were the only cultured people in the whole\\nKingdom and looked down upon women from other parts of the Empire.\\nManimekalai was irritated. Even if she were to get the Thanjavur throne, or for\\nthat matter the celestial throne itself, she told her people in no uncertain terms\\nthat she would never marry Madhuranthakan.\\n\\nAnother piece of information hardened her stand. When the Senior\\nPazhuvettaraiyar came to Kadambur a few months ago she heard that his newly\\nmarried wife the Junior Queen had also come along. But the Junior Queen never\\nvisited the ladies’ chambers of the Palace. At first this was surprising. And a\\nlittle hurting too. The women of the Kadambur Palace started talking ill of the\\nJunior Queen. They even despised her. And then slowly the truth came out.\\nManimekalai came to know that the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur was not in the\\nclosed palanquin that had come to the Palace. It was Madhuranthakan.\\nManimekalai’s hatred for the Prince went sky high.\\n\\n“Chee... that coward travelled in a closed palanquin disguised as a lady! And\\nthey want me to marry him! Never!”\\n\\nAt the same time that Madhuranthakan was smuggled into the Palace in a closed\\npalanquin, Vandhiya Thevan had also arrived. Kandhanmaran had brought him\\nto the ladies chambers only for a short time. Manimekalai became shy all of a\\nsudden. She stood behind the other women and stole glances of her dream-lover.\\n\\n\\x0cShe did not even have the chance of looking him directly on his face. And yet\\nVandhiya Thevan’s smiling face got etched into her heart. His voice and the few\\nwords he spoke got embedded in her mind.\\n\\nManimekalai then reopened the arguments with her brother. She told him clearly\\nthat even if the three-eyed Lord Shiva were to appear before her and command\\nher to marry Madhuranthakan she would not budge. Though she had seen\\nVandhiya Thevan only for a short time, she hinted to her brother that her heart\\nwas lost to him. Kandhanmaran was furious. At first he spoke softly trying to\\nconvince her. But when all his attempts failed he burst out.\\n\\n“Vandhiya Thevan is not my friend. He is my enemy. He tried to kill me by\\nstabbing me in the back. And if you try to marry him I’ll kill you both.”\\n\\nHe showed the stab-wound to his sister. He also told her that it was only because\\nof the Junior Queen Nandini’s kindness that he was restored to life.\\n\\n“And if you have even a morsel of love in your heart towards your only sibling\\nplease forget Vandhiya Thevan.”\\n\\nManimekalai’s heart changed. She loved her brother Kandhanmaran more than\\nanybody else in the world. It was impossible to marry somebody who was her\\nbrother’s avowed enemy, somebody who tried to kill her brother by stabbing him\\nin the back.\\n\\nAt the same time it was not possible for her to forget Vandhiya Thevan.\\nVandhiya Thevan’s smiling face would appear in her heart at the most\\nunexpected time. The face came while she was day-dreaming. The face\\n\\n\\x0cdominated her nocturnal dreams as well.\\n\\nAll these robbed Manimekalai of her natural enthusiasm and happiness. She was\\ndepressed all the time. The elders thought that the depression was because of the\\ndelay in her marriage. Her friends in her age group made fun of her. Some tried\\nto lift her moods by fun and frolic. None of their ideas worked.\\n\\nManimekalai started regaining her enthusiasm after some time. She was relieved\\nto know that her parents and her brother had abandoned the idea of marrying her\\nto Madhuranthakan. They were now discussing her marriage with the Crown\\nPrince Adithya Karikalan.\\n\\nThere was nobody in Tamilnadu, man or woman, who did not know about the\\nvalour and accomplishments of Adithya Karikalan. They also knew that for\\nsome reason Karikalan had been delaying his marriage. Well, to marry\\nsomebody like Adithya Karikalan... it was an honour one cannot even dream of.\\nMany princesses in the country were longing to be his wife. Manimekalai was\\nenthused by this new development.\\n\\nWhen she learnt that Adithya Karikalan from Kanchi and the Senior\\nPazhuvettaraiyar from Thanjavur were going to visit their Palace she became her\\nold enthusiastic, happy self once again. This time the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar\\nwas bringing his new wife for real.\\n\\nManimekalai was overawed by Nandini. She was the one who saved her\\nbrother’s life. She had heard a lot about Nandini’s beauty, her intelligence and\\nher qualities from her brother Kandhanmaran.\\n\\n\\x0cHer brother had also told her that she was the one who opened talks of\\nmatrimonial alliance with the Crown Prince. Kandhanmaran had also told her\\nthat when the Junior Queen stayed in their palace Manimekalai should be\\npersonally taking care of her. Manimekalai loved the assignment. She had her\\nown reasons. She wanted to be friends with Nandini and learn the latest fashion\\ntricks of the proud Thanjavur ladies and later beat them in their own game in\\ntheir home ground.\\n\\nHence for the past one week Manimekalai was not just enthusiastic but was\\nexcited. She was busy making arrangements for the Royal guests. She\\nconcentrated on the portion allotted to Nandini. She made sure that nothing was\\nleft out. Her brother was repeatedly insisting the need for providing top class\\nhospitality to Nandini.\\n\\nManimekalai gave hell to the workers of the Palace. She also tortured her\\nfriends. Every object placed in Nandini’s room was shifted at least thirty times.\\n\\nManimekalai frequented the chambers reserved for Adithya Karikalan and his\\nfriends quite often. She had heard that Adithya Karikalan was coming along with\\nhis friend Parthibendra Pallavan.\\n\\n‘How will his friend be? Will he remain loyal and faithful to the Crown Prince?\\nOr will he betray him? Who will change when, nobody knows. My brother’s\\nfriend Vandhiya Thevan originally belonged to Adithya Karikalan’s camp. If only\\nhe had not become a foe, if only he had not betrayed her brother, he too would\\nhave come here now.\\n\\nThough Manimekalai made herself busy with a host of exciting activities, she\\ncould not completely forget that lovable traitor.\\n\\n\\x0cManimekalai heard that the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur, Nandini, would arrive on\\nthat day. She checked the chambers reserved for Nandini one last time. She came\\nbefore the mirror leaning on the wall. She saw her face in the mirror. She was\\nlost in thoughts. Her beauty was no less than the most beautiful woman of her\\ntimes. The thought made her contented.\\n\\nWhen she decided to move away from the mirror she saw another face in the\\nmirror. And the other face was very close to hers. Close enough to brush against\\nher cheeks. That was the face of the warrior of the Vana Clan - Vandhiya Thevan\\n- which was troubling her in her waking state as well as in her dreams. Before\\nshe could realise what was happening her mouth raised a strange sound.\\n“Kooooooooooooooooo”.\\n\\nThe other face vanished.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 7 - The Monkey Without A Tail\\n\\nManimekalai thought for a while. She clearly remembered seeing somebody.\\nWas it an apparition or a mere hallucination? Or was she dreaming? If it were a\\ndream she should be in a state of sleep. She pinched herself. It hurt. No, she was\\nnot sleeping. This is the personal chamber being made ready for the stay of the\\nJunior Queen of Pazhuvur. Yes, she could now clearly see her face in that\\nmarble-mirror. And there the oil lamp was burning. She looked at the wall\\nopposite to the mirror. She now remembered. There is a secret passage on the\\nwall opposite to the marble-mirror. The doors to the passage could be opened\\neither from this chamber or from the other end. Manimekalai placed her ears\\nclose to the wall and listened. The door to the secret passage was made of wood.\\nShe could hear some sound from the Hunters’ Hall which was on the other side\\nof the door.\\n\\nShe gently opened the door to the passage. She peeped into the Hunters’ Hall to\\nhave a glimpse. A major part of the hall was plunged in darkness. There was a\\nsmall oil lamp in the corner of the hall. Suddenly the light from the lamp faded.\\nAfter a second or so it became bright again. Something must have gone past the\\nlamp. That explained the sudden fading of the light.\\n\\nThe face of the figure that blocked the light from the lamp..... Oh My God... did I\\nsee that face in the mirror a little while ago? Or have I started seeing sights\\nwhich others don’t see? Am I hallucinating?\\n\\nWhile still peering into the hall Manimekalai clapped her hands. “Who’s there?”\\n- she asked in a soft voice. She could hear somebody clearing their throat. A bat\\nwhich was hanging on the roof flew to the other end of the hall. And then she\\nheard a very light coughing sound.\\n\\n\\x0cWhile still remaining there she shouted for her maid “Chandramathi….. “\\n\\n“Why, Amma? Any problem?”\\n\\n“Take a lamp and come here. Right now.”\\n\\nA few seconds later a maid appeared with a lamp in her hand.\\n\\n“Why do you need a lamp here, Amma? The room is already well lit.”\\n\\n“I want to go into the Hunters’ Hall.”\\n\\n“There will be nothing but a few bats fluttering their wings.”\\n\\n“No. A few minutes ago as I was seeing this mirror I saw a face near mine.”\\n\\n“How did the face look like? Was that the face of Love God? Or the legendary\\nArjuna of Mahabharata?” - The maid laughed.\\n\\n“Hey Chandramathi, are you teasing me?”\\n\\n\\x0c“No, Amma. You always talk about a face which you frequently see in your\\ndreams. Perhaps the same person appeared in the mirror.”\\n\\n“Yes, you are right. But this time it was real.”\\n\\n“Almost all girls lose their minds at a stage in their lives. Your hallucination will\\ncontinue for another two, three days. When you see the Crown Prince the old\\nface will vanish forever.”\\n\\n“Let’s have a look at the Hunters’ Hall now. Come.”\\n\\n“That’s sheer waste, Amma. The Hall will be full of dust. You’ll spoil your nice\\nsaree.”\\n\\n“I don’t mind.”\\n\\n“You’ll start to cough and sneeze. Remember all those people are coming\\ntomorrow.”\\n\\n“Let them come. We’ll have to check the Hunters’ Hall right now. Hold the lamp\\ncarefully. Guard the flame. Let it not go off when we are there.”\\n\\nManimekalai entered the Hunters’ Hall. The maid followed her with a lamp in\\n\\n\\x0cher hand. They were slowly looking around the large hall. Chandramathi\\nfocussed on the lifeless animals above the lamp while Manimekalai’s eyes swept\\nacross the hall occasionally looking down on the floor for any sign of recent\\ndisturbance. She made a mental note of fresh foot prints on the mud floor.\\n\\n“Amma! Look there.”\\n\\n“What? Why are you shouting?”\\n\\n“That monkey without a tail appeared to move a little.”\\n\\n“Perhaps it is happy to see you, dear.”\\n\\n“Why are you teasing me, Amma?”\\n\\n“Didn’t you tease me that I had gone crazy and hallucinating images of men?”\\n\\n“Perhaps you must have seen the same monkey’s face in the mirror. See, the\\nmonkey is right opposite to the entrance of the hall. See, Amma, the monkey is\\nmoving again.”\\n\\n“No, it’s the shadow caused by your lamp. When the shadow moves it appears to\\nyou as if the monkey is moving. Come let’s go. I don’t see anybody here.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Then, Amma, you must have seen only the monkey’s face in the mirror. Or else\\nit must be the face of that owl. The one sitting on the top. See how he stares at\\nus!”\\n\\n“Why do you include me with you? The owl is bowled over by your beauty and\\nis staring at you.”\\n\\n“Then what did you see in the mirror?”\\n\\n“Do you think I am crazy? The same face which appears in my dreams appeared\\nin this mirror. After having seen that handsome face, I feel bad to see this\\nmonkey and the owl. Come let’s go. Let me see if I can see the face again in the\\nmirror.”\\n\\nThe two girls retraced their steps and entered the personal chambers laid out for\\nthe Junior Queen.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan came out from behind the monkey without tail. He sneezed\\ntwo, three times to get out the dirt and dust that had gone into his system. He\\nthen expressed his gratitude to the tailless monkey which had shielded him from\\nthe ladies.\\n\\n“O’ Monkey, may you live long! When that stupid maid compared my face to\\nyours, I was furious. I even thought of stepping out. Thank God, I changed my\\nmind at the last moment. If only you had not been here, what would have\\nhappened to me? I would have been caught by those girls. Monkey, may you be\\nblessed.”\\n\\n\\x0cEven while saying these words a part of his mind reminded him that even if he\\nwas caught by the girls nothing untoward would have happened. He had guessed\\ntheir identities. He could clearly hear their conversation. Manimekalai spoke in a\\nloud, clear voice. Didn’t she say about the face she saw in the dream and the one\\nshe saw in the mirror? What was she talking about?\\n\\nHis friend Kandhanmaran had told him that he used to share stories about him\\nwith his sister. Last time when he came to this Palace, Kandhanmaran had told\\nhim that she was going to be married off to some groom of high stature. Perhaps\\nthis crazy girl had not yet changed her mind. Oh My God!\\n\\nThere was no time to consider the feelings of that soft girl. He had to find a way\\nout of the dark chamber. If he used the lever in the shape of the elephant’s tusk it\\nopened the way to the ladies’ chambers. Now that way would not be useful for\\nhis purpose. He knew very well that the lever to open a secret door from inside\\nwould be different from the level used to open the door from outside. Now he\\nhad to find out the exact levers. But before that he should know where the secret\\npassage was\\n\\nHe was staring at the wall for a long time. No secret passage was visible. The\\nlight was not sufficient. Then he remembered seeing a crocodile near the place\\nwhere he entered this place. If only he went there and examined the wall perhaps\\nhe might find a way out of this maze.\\n\\nHe went near the embalmed crocodile and felt the surrounding walls with his\\nhands. He could find nothing. As time passed he became more and more\\nanxious.\\n\\n\\x0c‘Oh My God’ Vandhiya Thevan shuddered. He was now trapped in the\\nunderground dungeons. There was no way out but for the ladies’ chambers. Even\\nthat was dangerous.\\n\\nPerhaps Manimekalai might have a soft corner for him. But how could he\\nexplain his presence there in the ladies chambers of Sambuvaraiyar’s Palace?\\n\\n‘Can I say that my love for you brought me here? I could not remain without\\nseeing you. Will that not be a very cruel lie? Even if I harden my heart to tell that\\nkind of a lie will she believe me? And what was the guarantee that Manimekalai\\nwill be alone in the chambers? If I am is caught amongst a group of palace girls?\\nIf the news reaches Sambuvaraiyar, he won’t think twice before killing me.’\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan’s eyes looked at the embalmed crocodile lying on the floor. He\\nwas furious. “Oh Crocodile, why are you keeping your mouth so widely open?”\\nHe kicked the crocodile pretty hard. The crocodile moved a little. At the same\\ntime a small gap opened up on the floor near the wall.\\n\\n“Oh, you were the one blocking the way so far. You idiot crocodile! Why didn’t\\nyou tell me earlier?”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan bent down and moved the crocodile further. As the crocodile\\nmoved, the hole near the wall became larger and larger. A flight of stairs became\\nvisible.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 8 - Two Hands In The Dark\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan was awestruck by the way the secret passages and their\\nentrances and exits were planned in Sambuvaraiyar’s Palace. If a person not\\nfamiliar with those secret passages dared to venture into one of them, well, he\\nwas as good as dead. Vandhiya Thevan was now half way down the steps and if\\nfor any reason the crocodile is moved then he would be trapped in the hole. His\\nfate would be sealed.\\n\\nSo Vandhiya Thevan first made sure that the crocodile did not move on its own.\\nOnly then did he place his feet on the steps in the passage.\\n\\n‘Oh My God! I am now hearing the sound of footsteps from the other end. From\\nthe place where I entered this tunnel. Who is coming? Is it Azhwarkkadian? Is he\\ncoming for me? I should not let him come here now. He will be in trouble. No,\\nit’s just not one person coming. I can hear the footsteps of about five or six\\npeople. Then it must be Idumban Kari and his partners.’\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan sprang from his place. The next moment he was hiding behind\\nthe monkey without a tail.\\n\\n‘Oh My God! I have kept the secret passage open. Will that make those people\\nsuspicious? No way. Even when I came in the passage was open. It got closed on\\nits own only when I climbed up to the top-most step. In a way it’s better that the\\npassage is open. Yes, there I can see a head emerging from the hole. Yes, it is\\nIdumban Kari’s. He is now on the top most step. He is looking around. He has\\none foot on the step below. Perhaps he does not want the hole to close on its own\\nwhile he is there.\\n\\n\\x0cGood Heavens! I see light on this side of the wall. The elephant fixed on the wall\\nhas started to move. The door to the ladies’ chambers is open. Who is coming by\\nthat way? Oh My God! Manimekalai is coming again. She is holding a lamp.\\n\\nIdumbankari springs up from where he is standing. The hole through which he\\nemerged closes on its own. Idumbankari removes the piece of cloth and tries to\\ndust the embalmed tiger near him. Oh My God! How and when will this drama\\nend?’\\n\\nManimekalai lifted the lamp high and looked around. Her eyes rested on\\nIdumban Kari. There was an expression of surprise on her face. Idumban Kari\\nstopped dusting and looked back at the Kadambur Princess.\\n\\n“Your Highness! At this time? What happened?”\\n\\n“Is that you, Idumba? What are you doing here?”\\n\\n“Your Highness, the royal guests might want to look at the Hunters’ Hall. I am\\ntrying to keep the hall as clean as possible. Prince has issued orders to that effect\\nbefore he left for Kanchi.”\\n\\n“Yes, Idumba. The Prince believes only you and me in the whole palace. I was\\njust checking the room we have got ready for the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur. I\\nheard some noises from here. I thought you should be here. For who else knows\\nthe secret passages of this Palace better than you, Idumba? How long have you\\nbeen working here, Idumba?”\\n\\n\\x0c“About thirty minutes, Your Highness. I have about another thirty minutes of\\ncleaning-work here. But Your Highness why did you come alone? What\\nhappened to that chatterbox, Chandramathi?”\\n\\n“I was worried about the noises coming from here. So I have sent her to fetch\\nmy father. Now that I know that you are here I’ll stop her.”\\n\\nManimekalai lifted the lamp to study the change of expression in Idumban Kari’s\\nface. Then she looked at the monkey without a tail. She also saw the animal\\nmaking a slight movement as it did on an earlier occasion.\\n\\n“You are right, Your Highness. The King has so much on his plate. You may\\nplease retire for the day. I’ll take care of the work, Your Highness.”\\n\\nManimekalai retraced her steps to the chamber. The secret door closed.\\n\\nIdumban Kari went near the face of the elephant and placed his ear on the wall.\\nOnce he was sure that the other room was quiet he came back and opened the\\nhole. He went down the steps. His hip was at the floor level. He could hear an\\nowl hooting from inside the hole. Idumban Kari too hooted like an owl to return\\nthe signal. Vandhiya Thevan could now hear the sound of footsteps approaching\\nthe hole. Things started to move pretty fast after that.\\n\\nA bat flew across the hall noisily fluttering its wings. Idumban Kari saw the bat.\\nThe very next second the monkey without a tail fell on him. The fall was quite\\nsudden and the least expected. Idumban Kari lost his balance. His knees folded.\\n\\n\\x0cHe was forced to go two steps down. He did not know what hit him. He tossed\\nhis hands as if to get rid of something. His mouth was uttering some gibberish as\\nhe was frantically waving his hands. Finally he found that the embalmed tail-less\\nmonkey had fallen on him accidentally. He now regained his courage and tried to\\nrestore the monkey to its original place.\\n\\nMeanwhile what looked like a pair of human hands appeared from above the\\nmonkey-figure and tried to push him further down. Idumbankari could not\\nbelieve his eyes. He was frightened. He looked up and down. He noticed that the\\ntail-less monkey had entered the hole head down. Half of the monkey’s body had\\ndisappeared. And the door to that hole was closing in on the monkey. He was\\nnow sure that what appeared as human hands must be his hallucination.\\n\\nBy that time, the others had come close. Ravidasan led the pack. “Hey, why did\\nyou scream? You were talking some gibberish. Any danger? Do you want us to\\ngo now?”\\n\\n“No, no. Nothing. There are no dangers. As I was opening the door to the hole\\nthis giant-size embalmed monkey fell on me. I was scared. Now this monkey is\\nblocking our way. Give me a few seconds. Let me move the monkey and clear\\nthe way for us to go.”\\n\\nEven now, Lady Fortune favoured Vandhiya Thevan. When Idumban Kari was in\\nthe hole looking at the flying bat, Vandhiya Thevan pushed the tail-less monkey\\non him. And then he hid his face behind the monkey and used his hands to push\\nhim further down. And finally he moved the crocodile as well.\\n\\nHe did all these in a matter of seconds and ran back to the face of the elephant.\\nHe got hold of the elephant’s tusks and turned them with all his might. An\\nopening appeared on the wall. But it was not as wide as the entrance from inside\\n\\n\\x0cthe ladies’ chambers. This was much narrow. Probably there was a door within a\\ndoor. Vandhiya Thevan did not have the time to find out the way to open the\\ndoor fully. He had to enter that small opening before the crowd of conspirators\\ncame to the Hunters’ Hall. Otherwise he could never escape from them.\\n\\nSo he decided to slide through the narrow passage. He squeezed himself into that\\ncircular hole. His head, hands and half of his trunk went in. He could not\\nsqueeze in the other half of his body. There was nothing to hold on to. At that\\ntime the lamp in the room had been put off and darkness surrounded him.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan shouted for help:\\n\\n“Chandramathi! Chandramathi! Help! Please save me! I am dying.”\\n\\nHe heard a woman laughing aloud.\\n\\n“Oh My God, Chandramathi are you here? What are you looking at? Why are\\nyou not helping me? Is it fair? Is it good?”\\n\\n“Your entering the ladies chambers by stealth is neither fair nor good.” The\\nwoman’s voice was firm.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan now realised that the voice belonged to Manimekalai. But he\\nfeigned ignorance.\\n\\n\\x0c“Chandramathi, I came in here because you wanted me to come. People are\\nbehind me. Please pull me in. Otherwise I’ll be killed.”\\n\\n“Is Chandramathi so smart? Ok. Let her come. I’ll teach her a lesson as well.”\\n\\n“Oh, then you must be Princess Manimekalai. Your Highness, I beg of you,\\nplease forgive me. And save me from danger. I promise you I won’t indulge in\\nsuch acts again. May you be always blessed, Princess.”\\n\\nTwo slender hands reached for Vandhiya Thevan’s mighty shoulders. The hands\\nheld the shoulders and then gently pulled him down to the floor of the ladies\\nchamber. The opening in the wall closed on its own.\\n\\n“A hundred million thanks to you, Princess.”\\n\\n“Your thanks can wait till you know what I am going to do to you.”\\n\\n“Whatever you do is okay with me Your Highness. You have rescued me from\\nthose damned killers. That’s more than enough for me. Having escaped death\\nfrom the hands of those heartless demons, to die at your beautiful hands is a\\ngreat blessing.”\\n\\n“Oh My God! You talk like a warrior. Now tell me about the killers who are after\\nyou. But before that let me have a look at your face.\\n\\n\\x0c“Why should you see my face, Your Highness? When you were looking at the\\nmarble mirror a monkey’s face appeared from behind. And that face is mine,\\nYour Highness.”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan could hear the sound of bangles and the sound of the Princess\\nlaughing. When Vandhiya Thevan had stuck his head into the ladies chamber\\nearlier, Manimekalai had covered the lamp in the room. And now she removed\\nthe cover. The lamp glowed again. When she saw Vandhiya Thevan’s face she\\nforgot herself.\\n\\nA group of people were entering the Hunters’ Hall at the same time.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 9 - The Dog Barked\\n\\nManimekalai froze. Her eyes were fixed on Vandhiya Thevan’s face. Vandhiya\\nThevan smiled.\\n\\nWhat can I tell this girl? How can I get away from her?\\n\\nAt that time a voice called from a distance and broke Manimekalai’s trance.\\n\\n“Amma, did you call me?”\\n\\n“No. I didn’t.” Manimekalai shouted back.\\n\\nManimekalai went near the hole from which Vandhiya Thevan emerged. She\\nlocked the door. She then signalled to Vandhiya Thevan to follow her and took\\nhim to the other end of the room.\\n\\nShe suddenly turned back and asked him:\\n\\n“Now is the time to tell the truth. You said Chandramathi asked you to come\\nhere? Is that true?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Yes, Your Highness.”\\n\\n“When and where did she see you?”\\n\\n“Just a little while ago. I was standing behind the monkey. You saw the monkey\\nand then went back. After you turned back she told me, “Monkey, can you come\\nto my chambers? It’ll be easy for me to frighten away the unwanted guests.\\nPerhaps you didn’t hear her.”\\n\\nManimekalai smiled.\\n\\n“If I had heard I would have blasted her.”\\n\\n“Why are you angry with her, Princess? If my face closely resembles that of the\\ntail-less monkey, poor girl, what can Chandramathi do?”\\n\\n“Your face is nowhere near that of the monkey. It’s far from that.”\\n\\n“Perhaps as far as the owl hanging above the monkey.”\\n\\n“Your face is neither that of the monkey, nor of the owl. But you are as naughty\\nas the monkey. At times you blink your eyes like an owl. Did you stick your\\nhead out through this marble mirror a few minutes ago?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Yes, Your Highness. I did.”\\n\\n“Then why did you retreat and close the door?”\\n\\n“I saw an angel’s face very close to mine. I thought that the angel might be\\nscared if she saw my face. I lifted my hands from the elephant’s tusk. The door\\nclosed on its own.”\\n\\n“Do you know who that angel was?”\\n\\n“I did not know at that time. And then I thought it over. I got her right.”\\n\\n“What do you know about her?”\\n\\n“The one I saw was no ordinary angel. In fact, I saw a Goddess whose feet are fit\\nto be worshipped by all the angels. The darling daughter of King Sambuvaraiyar,\\nthe one and only Princess Manimekalai Devi. The only sister of my dearest\\nfriend, Kandhanmaran.”\\n\\nManimekalai arched her eye-brows. She smiled. But it carried an expression of\\nhatred, fury and derision.\\n\\n“Oh, is that so? Is my brother your dearest friend?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Do you doubt it, Devi? What is there to doubt? Do you remember my coming\\nhere about four months ago? I even visited the ladies’ chambers to pay respect to\\nthe senior queens of this palace. Have you forgotten that, Devi?”\\n\\n“Oh, I remember. How can I forget that so soon? So you are then the great\\nVallavaraiyan Vandhiya Thevan, the famed Prince of the Vaana clan.”\\n\\n“Yes, Your Highness. I neither have a country to rule nor a Palace to live. And\\nyet I bear that high-sounding title “Araiyan” which in Tamil means the King.\\nYes, Devi. That’s the name of our clan. And I am the poor man you are referring\\nto. At one time your brother used to talk a lot about you. That was when we\\nworked together as part of the security force guarding the banks of the North\\nPennai River. I too had so many dreams, Your Highness. But then I lost them\\nall.”\\n\\nA strange thought appeared in Manimekalai’s mind.\\n\\n‘My brother Kandhanmaran said that this man tried to stab him. Why should he\\ndo that? Was it because of me? Kandhanmaran must have said that Vandhiya\\nThevan can’t dream of marrying me. Vandhiya Thevan must have been dejected\\nand disappointed. And he must have picked up fight with my brother.’\\n\\nThe thought filled her mind with a strange kind of pleasure. Manimekalai\\nstruggled hard to mask that pleasure and express that as her fury.\\n\\n“There is no need to remind me of the old stories. Tell me why you entered this\\nPalace by stealth. Don’t make me send for my father.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Didn’t I tell you, Devi? Some killers are after me. As I was running away from\\nthem I saw a hole in the ground. I thought it was a secret passage. All my\\nescape-routes were sealed. I had to get into that secret passage. And that brought\\nme here.”\\n\\n“Well, you are one of the bravest warriors I have ever seen. And I have seen\\nthousands. And have heard about millions. But never in my past have I heard\\nabout a warrior who is great when it comes to fleeing the enemy. The legendary\\nUtharakumaran of Mahabharatha should take lessons from you. On fleeing from\\nthe battle-front.”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan bit his tongue. He had thought of Manimekalai as an imbecile.\\nThe girl was quite sharp. She was making fun of him.\\n\\n“Devi, they were seven or eight people. I am fighting them all alone. They are\\narmed to their necks. I don’t have any weapon with me. My spear was washed\\naway in floods at the Coleroon River.”\\n\\n“In a way it’s good. That was a treacherous spear. It could stab a dear friend\\nfrom the back. It’s good that it was washed away in the floods.”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan was shocked. Before he could think of a response\\nManimekalai thundered:\\n\\n“Now is the time to tell the truth. Why did you come here? You were running\\naway from your killers? Or have you come here to kill somebody?”\\n\\n\\x0cVandhiya Thevan felt as if he had placed his foot on fire.\\n\\n“OH MY GOD! SHIVA SHIVA! NARAYANA! I have come here to kill whom?\\nDo you think I’ll kill my dear friend’s darling sister? What for?”\\n\\n“Who knows? I don’t know how you still manage to say “my dear friend”?\\nDidn’t you try to stab that dear friend on his back? Why? Perhaps you’ve come\\nhere for a similar purpose now. To stab somebody on their back.”\\n\\n“Oh My God! May the good heavens have some mercy on me! Did I stab\\nKandhanmaran? If I were forced to do that I’ll rather cut my hands than doing\\nthat meanest act of betrayal. Princess, who had the heart to utter those damned\\nlies?”\\n\\n“Who else but my own brother? If somebody else had said that I would not have\\nbelieved it.”\\n\\n“Did Kandhanmaran say that? Then I am really unfortunate. Somebody stabbed\\nhim on his back and had ditched him near the walls of Thanjavur Fort. He was\\nunconscious. I lifted him up and carried him to Chendhan Amudhan’s hut. I\\nmade sure that he recovered well. And now I have been amply rewarded for my\\nwork. Princess, tell me this at least. Why should I kill my dear friend? Did he\\noffer any reason?”\\n\\n“Yes, he did. You called me ugly. You had told him that the women in the\\nThanjavur Palace are real beauties. Kandhanmaran was furious and he slapped\\n\\n\\x0cyou. And you did not have the courage to fight him face to face. So you hid\\nbehind him and stabbed him on his back. Tell me is that true or not?”\\n\\n“Lie! Absolute falsehood! Before calling you ugly I would have plucked my\\ntongue out of my mouth. It was only your brother who insisted that I should\\nforget you forthwith.”\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\n“He said that a number of reigning emperors are in the queue to marry you. So\\nhe insisted that I should forget you.”\\n\\n“And you listened to him, right?”\\n\\n“Honestly I could not forget you altogether. From then on I’ve been seeing you\\nas my dear sister, Princess. Please take me to Kandhanmaran immediately. Or\\nelse call him here. Let me know why he uttered such a big lie. If the thinks that\\nas the truth, I’ll change his mind. Please, Devi...”\\n\\n“Whatever mission you started in Thanjavur you want to complete it here in\\nKadambur, right?”\\n\\n“I don’t get you, Devi.”\\n\\n“You tried to kill him there. You didn’t succeed. So...”\\n\\n\\x0c“Oh My God! Do you think that I am such a fool to come to his own palace to\\nkill him?”\\n\\n“Then why did you choose the secret passage?”\\n\\n“Now please listen. My killers are still in the next room. You can hear the\\nfootsteps and voices.”\\n\\n“Why should they kill you?”\\n\\n“They look like sorcerers. Perhaps they want to offer a human sacrifice. And\\nthey have chosen me.”\\n\\n“Oh, that’s why they identified somebody who has all the markings of Royal\\nblood.” Manimekalai laughed.\\n\\n“That surprises me as well. Why should they come for somebody with the face\\nof a monkey and the eyes of an owl? After listening to you I have a doubt.\\nPerhaps my dear friend Kandhanmaran has given orders to them. Please take me\\nto your brother, Devi. He can either clear his doubts. Or else let him kill me with\\nhis own hand. Why should he hire killers, Devi? Please call Kandhanmaran\\nimmediately.”\\n\\n“You need not be in such a great hurry. For Kandhanmaran is not in town.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Where is he?”\\n\\n“He has gone to Kanchi to fetch the Crown Prince Karikalan. They will all be\\nhere tomorrow night. Till then… you… “\\n\\n“Till then you want me to stay here? No, Devi. That is not proper.”\\n\\n“No. I never said that. The Junior Queen of Pazhuvur will come here shortly.\\nThen even air cannot enter this place without proper permission. You know\\nPazhuvettaraiyar. If he sees you here he’ll simply hack you to death. Oh My\\nGod, how the old man loves his wife!”\\n\\nManimekalai laughed.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan now remembered the events that happened when\\nPazhuvettaraiyar came to Kadambur earlier.\\n\\n“Oh, is it so? Does Pazhuvettaraiyar love his young wife so much?”\\n\\n“The whole world knows. Last time when they came here the old man did not\\nallow his Queen to visit us ladies in the palace. He is keeping her in his palm and\\nis taking excellent care of her. This time they are going to stay here for a few\\ndays. And they have insisted on separate chambers for the Queen. Will the old\\nman let her see us...? I don’t know.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Then what should I do, Devi?”\\n\\n“I am still thinking. Yes! My brother has a dedicated room for his weapons. I’ll\\ntake you there. Kandhanmaran will come only tomorrow evening. You can stay\\nthere till he comes. When he comes you can prove your side of the story.”\\n\\n“No, Devi. That’s neither fair nor safe. It’s highly risky.”\\n\\n“Why risky?”\\n\\n“If Kandhanmaran asks how I reached that place…. …..”\\n\\n“Tell him the truth.”\\n\\n“When I said the truth even you did not believe me, Your Highness. Even when\\nmy killers are in the next room you don’t believe my words.”\\n\\n“Ok, let me verify it myself.”\\n\\n“What are you going to verify, Your Highness?”\\n\\n\\x0c“I am going to the Hunters’ Hall and enquire the persons who are there. I want to\\nfind out whether they have come to kill you or whether you brought them with\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Oh My God! They are all ruthless killers, Devi. And if you are caught alone\\nwith them.... “\\n\\n“What can they do to me in my own Palace? Have a look at this.”\\n\\nManimekalai pulled out a small foldable knife from her hip.\\n\\n“Nobody can come near me. And even if they do, I have a hero like you by my\\nside.”\\n\\n“But, Devi, I am unarmed now.”\\n\\n“For the brave and skilful even a blade of grass can be a weapon. And your\\nname - Vallavaraiyan - hints about your skills. With weapons in hand even timid\\ngirls can fight. Why do we need a warrior like you? You need not worry at all.\\nThere is a person in the Hunters’ Hall who’s cleaning the place. He is our\\nservant. He could have brought the others to help him in his work, in which case\\nI must know them too. Let me find out why they have come here. Don’t stand\\nnear the door. Can you see that grain repository? Please stand over there till I\\ncome back. Will you?”\\n\\nManimekalai went to the door that led to the Hunters’ Hall and tried to open it.\\n\\n\\x0cVandhiya Thevan walked fast towards the repository and hid himself. The doors\\nof the repository were open. He looked in. It did not look like a repository for\\ngrains. There were steps. And on each step was a music instrument - the Veena,\\nthe yaazh and the drums. He looked up. It appeared as if the steps reached up to\\nthe ceiling.\\n\\nBy that time Manimekalai had entered the Hunters’ Hall.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan was quite surprised by her courage. At first he was worried\\nabout her safety. But then he consoled himself that she would be quite safe in her\\nown palace.\\n\\nThe door of the chamber opened and Chandramathi entered the hall. “Amma...\\nAmma… “\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan was shocked. He entered the room of musical instruments to\\nhide from Chandramathi.\\n\\n“Amma, the people from Thanjavur have reached the gates of our Fort. The\\nQueen wants you there. She has sent me to fetch you, Amma.”\\n\\nChandramathi looked around and walked towards the door to the Hunters’ Hall\\nwhich was open.\\n\\nFrom where she stood, she could have seen Vandhiya Thevan. So he climbed a\\nfew steps up. His knees hit a Veena and there was a distinct sound. Vandhiya\\n\\n\\x0cThevan was shocked and climbed a few more steps. His head hit the ceiling.\\nWhat a surprise! The ceiling which was a wooden plank moved up further.\\nVandhiya Thevan grew suspicious and tried to move the wooden plank with his\\nhand. The plank yielded. And he could see the light of an open space. He could\\nhear some sounds at a distance. He could see stars at a distance. Vandhiya\\nThevan’s heart jumped in joy.\\n\\nHe now removed the plank aside and climbed up. He now realised that he had\\nreached the terrace. He also remembered that when he visited the Palace a few\\nmonths ago he had slept exactly in that place enjoying the cool breeze. It was\\nhere that he hid behind the pillars and listened to the deliberations of the\\nassembly of conspirators. Vandhiya Thevan moved the plank again and closed\\nthe way through which he climbed up. Only then he realised that it was not easy\\nto locate that passage from the terrace. He did not have the luxury of time to\\nwonder how the passage had been perfectly planned. His first priority was\\nsurvival - to escape from the Palace unharmed. Lady Luck had been smiling at\\nhim all the time. There was a good chance that she would continue to favour\\nhim.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan looked around. He could see flags and festoons all over the\\nPalace. This is how a Royal reception should be.\\n\\nHe walked on the terrace carefully looking in all the directions before taking\\neach step. The terrace was virtually deserted. Vandhiya Thevan thanked his stars\\nand started walking fast.\\n\\nHe reached the spot where he had slept for the night when he visited the Palace a\\nfew months ago. From his position he could see the outer walls of the palace. He\\ncould also see the huge yard inside the palace, the place where the Kuravai\\nKoothu happened at that time, the place where the conspirators had congregated.\\nBut there was nobody in those places. Of course it did not require a genius to\\nknow why.\\n\\n\\x0cThe Palace gate was abuzz with activity. Hundreds of torches illuminated the\\nplace. There were drums and other musical instruments playing at a high pitch.\\nPeople’s hailing sound pierced the sky. Pazhuvettaraiyar’s retinue had reached\\nthe gates and the whole Palace was there to receive the visitors. That explained\\nthe absence of people at the place he stood. He could not have got a better\\nopportunity to escape from danger. He could not have got such an ideal\\nopportunity either if he had come ten minutes earlier or ten minutes later.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan walked to the spot where the conspirators had assembled. He\\nlooked around. There was nobody. He then looked down. There was nobody\\nthere. He saw the palace wall. There was nobody. But wait!\\n\\nOh My God! There is a human face appearing between the branches peering\\nover the wall. It looks like the face of Azhwarkkadian. No, no, that’s just a\\nhallucination! This is exactly the place where I saw his face when I came here\\nearlier. So my mind has deceived me once again. In a way that’s good. That’s the\\nbest point to jump over the wall. I need to escape before the crowd comes into\\nthe Palace after according a reception to the visiting dignitaries. But first I\\nshould get into the yard. How am I going to do it? Well, I can see a thatched\\nshed in the yard. Perhaps they are going to have Kuravai Koothu or some other\\nshow.\\n\\nA large bamboo pole buried deep into the ground to support the temporary\\nauditorium stretched up to the terrace. Vandhiya Thevan jumped on to it and slid\\ndown to the yard. He looked around. The place was still deserted. He could hear\\nthe sound of anklets from the place where he stood before jumping down.\\n\\nThat must be Manimekalai. Oh My God! If I am caught by her, my fate is sealed.\\n\\n\\x0cVandhiya Thevan ran across the open yard. He went near the wall and turned\\nback. He could see the figure of a lady over the terrace. But he was not sure\\nwhether it was Manimekalai or Chandramathi. Whosoever it was, she would\\nhave seen him running across the yard. She did not raise an alarm.\\n\\nWhosoever it is, may she be blessed.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan walked along the wall after blessing that woman. He reached\\nthe spot from where Azhwarkkadian’s face had appeared. But how to scale the\\nwall? It was so high and was perfectly even. A rough, up and down surface\\nwould have afforded a perfect grip for him to climb the wall. He then saw a few\\nbamboo poles lying on the ground. That must have been the surplus materials\\nbrought for erecting the thatched shed. He quickly picked a long bamboo pole.\\nHe made the pole lean on the wall. The pole was almost as high as the wall. Now\\nhe could climb the pole and reach the top of the wall. But how would he make\\nthe pole stand firm? What would happen if it slipped when he was half way up?\\nThen he would have a great fall. But there was no other way.\\n\\nHe tested the strength of the pole and started to climb. When he was half way up,\\nthe pole started to hobble and waver.\\n\\nIf I fall now all the bones in my body would go for a toss. Suddenly the pole\\nbecame firm. It looked as if a hand from above was holding the pole tight. Thank\\nGod, I’ve not become insane. Vandhiya Thevan continued to climb. When his\\nhands gripped the edge of the wall the pole slipped and fell down. The sound of\\nthe pole hitting against the ground appeared like the sound of thunder.\\nThankfully, the noise at the gate of the Fort was much higher. But the girl\\nstanding on the terrace would not have missed the sound. Vandhiya Thevan\\nturned around to look at her. She was still standing in the same position.\\n\\n\\x0cEven while in the middle of danger his mischievous qualities had not left him.\\nHe waved to the girl as if taking leave of her. He then started climbing down the\\nother side of the wall. Climbing down was not that difficult. The branches of the\\ntrees nearby helped him.\\n\\nWhen he thought of how he duped Manimekalai, he laughed out loud. He then\\nheard somebody laughing, as if echoing his laugh. His blood froze. His hands\\nstarted to tremble. He was just a few steps away from the ground and wanted to\\njump. There was a dog ready to pounce on him. He had no time to think. He\\ncould not climb up the wall again. He had to jump. But if he did, the dog would\\nsurely have its pound of flesh.\\n\\nDid he hear somebody laughing or was it the sound of the dog barking? Was the\\ndog sent by somebody who was hiding in the dark?\\n\\nWas it more dangerous to climb up the wall or to climb down? Vandhiya Thevan\\nwas in a dilemma. His legs were dangling in the air trying to escape the dog’s\\nmouth which was jumping higher and higher to catch them.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 10 - The Manhunt\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan was in a dilemma. Should he jump to the ground deftly\\nevading the dog’s mouth or should he scale up the wall again? He looked around\\nto see if anybody was hidden behind the trees. A white cloth seemed to move\\nbehind one of the trees. He remembered having heard somebody laughing. If a\\nman was hidden in the bushes.... Would that be one man or many? To jump to\\nthe ground without that information would be the greatest blunder. Even if he\\nmanaged to escape the dog’s mouth he was sure to be caught by the men.\\n\\nHe clearly remembered seeing Azhwarkkadian’s face over the wall when he was\\non the terrace.\\n\\nPerhaps that Vaishnavite has been bored of waiting at the Ayyanar temple. He\\nhas come here and has set the dog after me. Well, why don’t I check that right\\nnow? Why don’t I call him?\\n\\n“Oh Vaishnavite! What’s this you are doing?”\\n\\nHe heard somebody laughing once again. That was not Azhwarkkadian’s voice.\\nVandhiya Thevan now sure that the only way to survive was to scale up the wall\\nagain and get back into the Palace. He could easily find a way to hide himself in\\nthe elaborate festivities planned for receiving the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar. And\\nthen he would have to sweet talk Manimekalai into helping him go out. While\\ndoing that he would have to win over the affection of Nandini as well. Nandini\\nhad not betrayed him so far. There was no reason why she would do that now.\\n\\n\\x0cVandhiya Thevan tried to retrace his steps. He was climbing up the wall. The\\ndog tried to jump higher and higher. He heard the sound of laughter once again.\\nA figure emerged from behind the tree with a spear in the hand. Vandhiya\\nThevan knew that it was Devaralan, part of the conspiracy group. Devaralan\\ncame near Vandhiya Thevan.\\n\\n“Your stars are favourable, Young man. You always escape death at the nick of\\ntime.”\\n\\n“I know that. But tell me, why have you come to me again?”\\n\\n“Only to tell you, to show you that you can’t escape from me this time.”\\n\\nDevaralan aimed the spear at Vandhiya Thevan.\\n\\nIt was only then that Vandhiya Thevan realised that his life was in danger. How\\ncan a man dangling on the wall fight with a person standing on firm ground and\\nthat too when the latter was armed with a deadly spear? Well, in theory, he could\\njump to the ground to escape the spear. But the hunting dog was waiting for its\\npound of flesh.\\n\\n“Devarala, beware! Remember the orders of your boss, the Junior Queen of\\nPazhuvur. Didn’t your Queen issue orders not to harm me?”\\n\\nDevaralan laughed like a devil.\\n\\n\\x0c“The Queen of Pazhuvur is not my boss. My boss is Bhadrakali, Durga\\nParameswari. Yes, the Holy Mother alone is my boss.”\\n\\n“She’s my Holy Mother too. My clan worships her. She is our presiding deity. It\\nwas only because of Her grace that I could escape from a burning ship. If you try\\nto touch me, your Holy Mother will destroy you!”\\n\\n“If you are really a devotee of Durga Parameswari you should help me now. If\\nyou do, I won’t harm you.”\\n\\n“What do you want me to do? But before that, send this damned dog away.”\\n\\n“I saw a Vaishnava fanatic somewhere around here. If you help me to capture\\nhim, I’ll set you free.”\\n\\n“Why should you capture him?”\\n\\n“I have vowed to sacrifice a Vaishnava fanatic to Durga Devi.”\\n\\nPrecisely at that time the shrub that Vandhiya Thevan was holding tight for his\\nbalance, came off. Vandhiya Thevan was now exploring the possibilities of\\ndirectly falling on Devaralan in order to escape his spear.\\n\\n“That Vaishnavite is my dear friend. I’ll never betray him. Why don’t you\\nsacrifice me in his place?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Then be a victim to my spear.” Devaralan lifted the spear and aimed at\\nVandhiya Thevan.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan let the shrub go and jumped under the spear holding its edge.\\nAnd fell down in the process. Devaralan was shocked. Before he could come out\\nof the shock and lift the spear again, a figure armed with a heavy stick came\\nbehind him and hit his head with great force. Devaralan now fell on Vandhiya\\nThevan.\\n\\nThe dog pounced on the person who had attacked its master. Azhwarkkadian\\nwas prepared for that as well. He pulled off the cloth above his waist and\\ncovered the dog’s face. For a few seconds the dog went blind. Azhwarkkadian\\npulled out a creeper for a make-shift dog chain. With that creeper he bound the\\ndog to a tree.\\n\\nMeanwhile Vandhiya Thevan pushed Devaralan from him and stood up. A single\\nblow from the Vaishnavite was more than enough to render Devaralan\\nunconscious. Vandhiya Thevan and Azhwarkkadian foraged for some more\\ncreepers. They used them to bind Devaralan’s limbs. Vandhiya Thevan took the\\nspear and Azhwarkkadian, his stick. They left the place.\\n\\nExcept for the gates all the other sides of Sambuvaraiyar’s Palace were\\nsurrounded by thick forest. If somebody accidentally entered these forests it was\\nvery difficult to come out of them. The two men knew this very well and hence\\nkept walking close to the walls of the Palace.\\n\\nAzhwarkkadian shouted at Vandhiya Thevan.\\n\\n\\x0c“I thought you are smart.”\\n\\n“Are you referring to my entering that tunnel? Do you know how many things I\\nhave found out because of that?”\\n\\n“No, I am not talking about that. When that crook Devaralan asked you ‘Will\\nyou help me capture that Vaishnavite?’ you should have said a big “YES”. Why\\ndid you refuse and get caught?”\\n\\n“All because of the company I keep!”\\n\\n“Are you alluding to me? Have I ever told you to commit these blunders? I don’t\\nthink so.”\\n\\n“I am not referring to you. I am referring to Ponniyin Selvan. After spending\\ntime with him, I don’t have the heart to tell lies.”\\n\\n“Not even to save your life? Have you become such a true soul?”\\n\\n“That’s not the only reason. I know very well that you were hiding somewhere\\naround here. Suppose I were to tell Devaralan that, I’d betray you and suppose\\nyou heard that and suppose you believed that... I don’t think you would have\\nhelped me.”\\n\\n\\x0c“You are very smart, Young Man. There is no doubt about it. Honestly I was\\nanxious to know what answer you were going to give to that difficult question.”\\n\\n“See, my predictions have become true. I knew you’d doubt anything and\\nanybody. That apart, whatever the benefits I may get, I would never betray a true\\nfriend. But you promised to wait for me at Ayyanar Temple. How did you come\\nhere? If I had returned through that tunnel I’d have missed seeing you there in\\nthe temple.”\\n\\n“If you had chosen to return by that tunnel you would not have come out alive.\\nSoon after you went in, the conspirators followed suit. I know you are smart. So\\nI thought you’d choose some other way to come out. I even thought that you\\nmight choose to jump the wall here.”\\n\\n“Don’t tell me that you came here fully knowing that I’d choose this exact place\\nto appear!”\\n\\n“No, that’s not the only reason. The conspirators left Devaralan to guard the\\nentrance of the Ayyanar Temple. They wanted to make sure that nobody is in the\\ntemple when they came out of the tunnel. So they had some peculiar signal that I\\ndid not know. I thought everyone had entered the tunnel and was also worried\\nthat you were caught inside the tunnel. I also wanted to know how to open the\\ntunnel from outside. So I went to the temple’s altar and tried to move it. I heard\\nsome footsteps and looked around. Devaralan was coming towards me with a\\nspear. The conspirators had issued orders to kill me wherever and whenever I am\\nseen.\\n\\nI was not armed. I had no alternative than to flee. I was running through a dense\\nforest. He could not catch me. After some time I knew that I had lost him. I\\nthought of taking the high road. There was a small hut at a distance. A small oil\\n\\n\\x0clamp was the only source of light in the vicinity. I decided to go to the hut to ask\\nfor directions to the high road. Thank God I looked at the house carefully! I\\nnoticed this devil Devaralan standing there. A woman and a dog were near him.\\nDevaralan spoke something to the woman and then went off along with the dog.\\nThe dog sensed my presence and barked in my direction. I was in danger. I\\nabandoned the idea of taking the high road and ran back into the forest.\\n\\nAs the dog was continually barking I could guess where the conspirators were\\ngoing. As I was running away from danger my brain was hyper active. I knew it\\nwas impossible to stay in the forest all night. They will somehow find me. And\\nthat will be the end of me. At the same it will not be easy to manage Devaralan\\nwho was armed with a spear and a hunting dog armed with strong teeth.\\n\\nI happened to see the wall of this great building. I thought that if I could manage\\nto scale the wall and jump into the building then I can somehow manage to\\nescape from the conspirators. And I started climbing up the wall. When I was on\\ntop I saw you running across the terrace. I guessed that you will try to come out\\nthe Palace by scaling up the wall. So I jumped down on the other side. I was sure\\nthat if we joined hands we can manage Devaralan and the dog.\\n\\nI heard the sound of barking and I climbed up a tree. Devaralan and the dog\\ncame near the tree. Devaralan saw you getting down the palace wall. He took the\\ndog with him and went running towards you. And you know what happened\\nafter that.\\n\\n“Vaishnava, what are your views on the power of destiny?”\\n\\n“What’s this question? Why should you talk about destiny all of a sudden?”\\n\\n\\x0c“People say that the moment a person is born Lord Brahma, the Creator, writes\\nhis entire life history on his head. Do you believe that?”\\n\\n“No. I don’t believe in destiny. If destiny is all-powerful then there will be no\\npoint in our devotion to God. Do you know what our Azhwars have said about\\nit…? “\\n\\n“Let the Azhwars wait. I now have complete faith in destiny. Everything is preordained. Otherwise I would not have come out of the palace alive.”\\n\\n“Young man, you escaped not because of your fate but because of your\\nintelligence.”\\n\\n“No way! My intelligence led me to unknown dangers. It was my fate which\\nrescued me.”\\n\\nThey had come out of the forest by then. They could see the front entrance of the\\nKadambur Palace. The place was bustling with activity. The Senior\\nPazhuvettaraiyar’s retinue consisting of elephants, horses and infantry had just\\nreached the Palace gates. Sambuvaraiyar and his retinue were waiting at the\\nheavily decorated entrance to receive the visitor.\\n\\nHundreds of torches had converted night into day. A wide variety of drums and\\nhorns were being played.\\n\\nAzhwarkkadian grabbed Vandhiya Thevan’s hand. “Come let’s get out of here\\n\\n\\x0cbefore somebody sees us.”\\n\\n“Nobody can recognise us. Even if they do my destiny will save me. Should we\\nnot see the glorious sight of the Pazhuvettaraiyar getting down from his\\nelephant?”\\n\\n“Are you interested only in that?”\\n\\n“I also want to know whether Nandini has come with him in the elephant or in a\\nclosed palanquin.”\\n\\n“Don’t think fate will favour you always. At times it will come in the form of a\\nseductive witch and upset your life-cart.”\\n\\n“I can’t be so easily seduced, Vaishnava. There are others who’ll fall for her\\ncharms. Not me.”\\n\\nThe majestic elephant came to a stop at the Palace gate. The Senior\\nPazhuvettaraiyar got down from the pachyderm. Soon the Junior Queen of\\nPazhuvur, Nandini Devi followed suit.\\n\\n“Oh! This time he has openly taken the queen along with him. She did not come\\nin a closed palanquin.”\\n\\nThere was a tinge of sarcasm in his voice.\\n\\n\\x0c“I wanted to know only that. Come, let’s go.”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan moved back. This time Azhwarkkadian was not in a hurry. He\\nstood in the same place. He was looking at Nandini without batting his eye-lids.\\nIt may have been a mere coincidence or the mind-powers of the Vaishnavite Nandini turned to look at him.\\n\\nAzhwarkkadian’s face was looking at her from the midst of dark trees. The\\nmoment she saw his face she became pale. Pazhuvettaraiyar did not fail to notice\\nthe sudden change in his wife’s face. He also looked in the same direction. He\\nsaw two figures hiding behind the dark shadow cast by the trees.\\n\\nHe whispered something into the ears of Sambuvaraiyar. Sambuvaraiyar barked\\norders to two of his men.\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar and Nandini entered the palace amidst great fanfare.\\n\\nAt the same time two horsemen entered the forest just beyond the palace walls.\\nThey had to struggle hard to lead their horses into the dark forest. They rode on\\nfor a long distance and had reached the clearing beyond the forest. Still they\\ncould not find anybody\\n\\n“There’s nobody in the forest. It’s nothing but the hallucination of the old man.”\\n\\nAt that time they heard the howling of a dog.\\n\\n\\x0c“Do you know when a dog will howl?” - One of the horsemen asked.\\n\\n“When it sees a devil or a ghost or some supernatural apparition.”\\n\\n“Perhaps you look like a devil to the dog.”\\n\\n“No, brother. You look like a ghost.”\\n\\nThey heard a devilish laughter from above. They looked up. There were two\\nghosts sitting right above the two men in the tree. The two ghosts extended their\\nhands and slapped the two soldiers on their cheeks. The ghosts then placed their\\nhands on the necks of horsemen and pushed them off their horses.\\n\\nThen those naughty ghosts mounted the horses and crossed the forest and rode\\nfast in the clearing.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 11 - Is He A Friend Or A Traitor?\\n\\nThe Crown Prince Adithya Karikalan, his friends and his retinue were crossing\\nthe beautiful place where River Manimutha merged with River Vellaru. They\\nwere discussing the hospitality accorded to them at their last place of visit Thirumudhukunram. They were also discussing the temple renovation work\\nunder progress in that village.\\n\\n“I appreciate what Saint Sundaramurthy did at Thirumudhukunram.” Parthibendran opened a conversation.\\n\\n“What did he do?” The Crown Prince was curious.\\n\\n“The Saint refused to sing praises of an old woman.”\\n\\n“What was that? Tell me the whole story.”\\n\\nParthibendran started a long narration.\\n\\nAs a part of his pilgrimage the venerated saint Sundaramurthy Nayanar visited a\\nplace called Thirumudhukunram presently known as Virudhachalam. The\\npriests of the temple welcomed him and showed him around the temple.\\n\\n\\x0c“Your Holiness, we entreat you. Please compose some songs on our Lord and\\nGoddess. We’ll deem it a great honour.”\\n\\nThey pleaded with him.\\n\\n“Let’s see. But tell me what the name of your Lord is?” Sundaramurthy asked.\\n\\nThe word Thirumudhukunram had a connection with old age. So the Lord of the\\nplace was accordingly named as Virthagireeswarar, which literally meant the\\nOld Lord.\\n\\nThe Saint’s face fell. ‘Should I sing about an old man?’ He thought.\\n\\n“That’s okay. What’s the name of the Goddess?”\\n\\n“Viruthagireeswari.”\\n\\nThe word denoted an old Goddess.\\n\\n“You made my God an old man. Ok, let that be. Why have you made my Holy\\nMother also an old woman?”\\n\\nThe priests did not know how to respond.\\n\\n\\x0c“No, I won’t sing about an old man and his old lady.” The Saint walked out of\\nthe temple in apparent fury.\\n\\nNow the priests were worried. If somebody as great as Sundaramurthy Nayanar\\ndid not sing on their deities then their temple would not be considered holy\\nenough for pilgrimage. So they installed another statue of the Goddess and this\\ntime carefully named her as Balambikai, which meant a young woman.\\n\\nHaving done that they ran to Sundaramurthy and told him about the\\ndevelopments begging him to come to their village and sing on their young\\nGoddess.\\n\\nSundaramurthy relented. He went back to their village and sang a set of ten\\nsongs, called a padhikam in Tamil, on the young Goddess.\\n\\nAdithya Karikalan virtually rolled in laughter after hearing the story.\\n\\n“I think a poet would have told the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar similar to what the\\nSaint told the priests. He would have refused to sing the praises of the old man\\nand his old wife. Perhaps that was the motivation for the old man to marry a\\nyoung Nandini.”\\n\\nParthibendran and Kandhanmaran burst out into laughter. They laughed so much\\nthat at one time it appeared as if they were going to fall off from their horses.\\n\\n\\x0cParthibendran gathered himself to talk some philosophy.\\n\\n“I don’t know why God created old age. He should have let us be young till our\\ndestined time of death. That would have made our lives a lot easier.”\\n\\n“Whatever may be God’s law, to attain old age or not is in our hands.” The\\nCrown Prince retorted.\\n\\n“I don’t understand, Prince.” - Kandhanmaran questioned.\\n\\n“Do we think of the legendary Abhimanyu and Aravan of Mahabharata as old\\nmen?”\\n\\nThe other two were silent. They knew that those two heroes died pretty young.\\n\\n“In the art gallery attached to the Thanjavur Palace we have the paintings of all\\nmy ancestors. Vijayalaya Chozha, Adithya Chozha and Emperor Paranthaka\\nappear as old men. But my grandfather’s brother Rajadithya appears as a man in\\nthe prime of his youth. Do you know the reason? He died young. So in a way he\\nwas blessed with immortal youth. And people know him only as a young man. I\\ndon’t know how many of us will have that blessing.”\\n\\nThe other two did not like his words. They remained silent.\\n\\n“Why have you become silent? Are you so afraid of death? If this body goes\\n\\n\\x0caway we’ll get another. Why should we fear death? If only my friend Vandhiya\\nThevan were here he will happily endorse my opinion. It is very rare to find\\nsomebody as enthusiastic as Vandhiya Thevan. Even if you put him at the door\\nof death he will still be laughing.”\\n\\nThey saw two horses coming in the opposite direction. The horses were\\ngalloping very fast creating a cloud of dust as they moved. And in a flash the\\nhorses had come near them. The way the horses rode, it appeared as if they\\nmight go past them without caring to pay respects to the Crown Prince of the\\nChozha Kingdom. Kandhanmaran and Parthibendran were eager to know who\\nthose arrogant horse-riders were. They got ready to block the riders by wielding\\ntheir spears across the road. But the horses were stopped at a short distance from\\nthem.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan and Azhwarkkadian dismounted. The Crown Prince was\\necstatic on seeing Vandhiya Thevan. He threw all protocol to winds. He jumped\\nfrom his horse and went towards Vandhiya Thevan to hold him in a tight hug.\\n\\n“Thambi, you’ll live a hundred years and more. Just a second ago I was talking\\nabout you.”\\n\\nKandhanmaran and Parthibendran were burning in jealousy at this sudden show\\nof affection. They moved their horses a little away from the Crown Prince.\\n\\nThey saw a few more horses coming at a distance. Those horses too stopped near\\nthem. Kandhanmaran noticed that the horse riders were from his place,\\nKadambur. He went near them and made enquiries.\\n\\n\\x0cHe then came to Adithya Karikalan.\\n\\n“Prince, this Vandhiya Thevan is your friend. He was my friend too, once upon a\\ntime. But I have to level grave charges against him. He is a traitor. He stabbed\\nme in the back. So, Your Highness, it is my bounden duty to advise you to be\\nvery careful with this man.”\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 12 - The Broken Spear\\n\\nKandhanmaran levelled charges against his friend Vandhiya Thevan. Adithya\\nKarikalan laughed out loud.\\n\\n“You mean to say that this Vandhiya Thevan stabbed you on your back,\\nKandhanmaran? But why did you show your back to him?”\\n\\nThe Crown Prince laughed again.\\n\\nThe dark face of Kandhanmaran went red with anger. His eyes became red and\\nhis lips quivered.\\n\\n“Prince, do you consider this a laughing matter?”\\n\\n“Kandhamara! Are you saying that I should not laugh? Laughter is a boon given\\nby God exclusively to human beings. The cow can’t laugh. Nor can the sheep.\\nThe horse or the lion can’t laugh. Even monkeys who love to play mischief all\\nthe time can’t laugh. Only human beings can laugh. Then why do you want to\\nstop my laugh? Do you know my friend that it’s aeons since I had a hearty\\nlaugh? I am surprised by the sound of my own laughter. And you are telling me\\nnot to laugh.”\\n\\n“Prince, Your happiness only makes me happier. But please don’t think that I\\nshowed my back to this all-time great warrior. At the most unexpected moment\\n\\n\\x0chiding behind my back he stabbed me. It was because of the grace of my Holy\\nMother, Durga Devi and thanks to the kindness of Nandini Devi that I am alive\\ntoday. I entreat you to please enquire into this blatant act of betrayal and render\\njustice to me. Or at least please give me powers to punish him.”\\n\\n“My dear friend, please wait. Let me enquire into your charges. I’ll see to it that\\nyou get justice. Nobody who has sought justice from a member of the great\\nSembian clan has returned empty-handed. One of the earliest kings of our clan,\\nEmperor Sibi, cut his flesh in order to save a dove from the clutches of an eagle.\\nManuneethi Chozhan, another King in our dynasty, sacrificed his own son in\\norder to right the wrong done to a cow. You are not inferior to a dove or a cow.\\nJustice will not be denied to you... But you will have to be patient till I finish my\\nenquiry.\\n\\n“Vandhiya Theva, before you render an account of your travel, you should\\nanswer the charge levelled against you by Kandhanmaran. What is your defence\\nfor this grave charge? Did you really stab him on his back? And if you did, why\\ndid you do that cowardly act of betrayal which is quite unbecoming of a warrior\\nof your stature?”\\n\\n“Prince, I did not stab this warrior. Stabbing on the back.... I cannot even think\\nof that, Prince. Nor did I hide myself in order to do that act of cowardice. I saw\\nhim bleeding and unconscious. I found him stabbed in the back. I bore him on\\nmy shoulders and went all the way to Chendhan Amudhan’s house to save him.\\nBut I now regret my decision of having saved his life. I regret that I did not kill\\nhim by stabbing him on his chest. I am sorry, Your Highness, I let my love for a\\nfriend take precedence over loyalty to my King. He accused me of having\\nbetrayed a friend. But this man has not only betrayed his friend but his Master as\\nwell. Ask him where did that back-stabbing incident happen and under what\\ncircumstances. Ask him who he secretly brought to the Thanjavur Palace\\nthrough the secret tunnel. Ask him whom did he see in the Senior\\nPazhuvettaraiyar’s treasury. Ask him what happened at the Kadambur Palace on\\nthe 18th day of Adi, the day celebrated as Adi Perukku in Tamilnadu. Ask him\\n\\n\\x0cwho came in the closed palanquin to Kadambur Palace on that day.”\\n\\nKandhanmaran trembled. He could not speak clearly. “Stop talking rubbish, lowborn worthless idiot. Otherwise you’ll become a prey to my spear!”\\n\\nKandhanmaran took out his spear.\\n\\nAdithya Karikalan was surprised by this sudden display of emotions. He grabbed\\nthe spear from Kandhanmaran. And then with his iron hands tried to bend the\\nspear. It broke. The Crown Prince threw away the two pieces of the broken\\nspear.\\n\\n“BEWARE! I CAN’T TOLERATE MY FRIENDS FIGHTING IN MY\\nPRESENCE. PARTHIBENDRA IF ANY OF THESE TWO WIELD A SPEAR\\nOR A SWORD TO ATTACK THE OTHER, IT’S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY\\nTO ARREST THEM.”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan pulled out his sword and gave it to Parthibendran who\\nreluctantly got it from him.\\n\\n“Kandhamara, Vandhiya Thevan has answered your charges. I’ll take my time to\\nverify the truth in his statements and pronounce my judgment. Meanwhile are\\nyou going to answer his questions now?”\\n\\nKandhanmaran was in a fix. “Your Highness I am under an oath not to disclose\\nor discuss those matters.”\\n\\n\\x0cParthibendran intervened.\\n\\n“Your Highness, judging from the way these people trade charges I am afraid\\nthat the problem centres around a woman. It will be better if you enquire them\\nseparately.”\\n\\n“You are right, Parthiba. I too thought so. All the three of you have fallen in the\\nnet of seduction cast by the Pazhuvur Queen. That explains your urgency to\\ndestroy each other.”\\n\\nParthibendran’s face fell. Yet he wanted to fire his salvos against Vandhiya\\nThevan.\\n\\n“Your Highness, I presume that today you’ve taken a vow to take serious matters\\nquite lightly and make fun of them. Let that be so. Please give me a chance to\\nexplain my side, Your Highness. I have my own doubts on Vandhiya Thevan. I’ll\\nshare only the important ones with you. Your dear brother jumped into the sea\\nonly to save this man from a burning ship. And we never saw Ponniyin Selvan\\nafter that. But this man here is as strong as ever. As hale and healthy as he was\\nwhen he was caught in the ship. And has suddenly surfaced here. Ask him what\\nhappened to your brother. If your brother was drowned in the sea then this man\\nis fully responsible for that.”\\n\\nKarikalan turned to Vandhiya Thevan - “What’s your answer for this?”\\n\\n“Before I answer his charge let him answer my question. It was this man who\\n\\n\\x0ctook Ponniyin Selvan on his ship. Chief Minister Aniruddha Brahmarayar and\\nLankan General Bhoothi Vikrama Kesari had advised Ponniyin Selvan not to\\nmove out of Lanka. But Ponniyin Selvan, out of love and respect for his elder\\nbrother, bowed down to his request. He got into this man’s ship. And it was the\\nresponsibility of this man to deliver Ponniyin Selvan safely into your hands.\\nWhy didn’t he do that? When Ponniyin Selvan jumped in the middle of the sea,\\nwhy this man remained a silent spectator? Why did not he prevent the Prince\\nfrom jumping into the sea?\\n\\n“I am a poor man, Your Highness. I am an orphan, Your Highness. And yet\\nPonniyin Selvan risked his life to save me. This man Parthibendran is a\\nrenowned warrior of the Pallava clan. He had a duty to protect the life of our\\nPrince. Ask him why didn’t he or his men jump into the sea to save Ponniyin\\nSelvan?”\\n\\nParthibendran was furious. His hands and lips quivered.\\n\\n“Prince, this fool is now accusing me. He might even say that it was I who killed\\nthe Prince. I can’t bear this nonsense.”\\n\\nKarikalan looked deeply into his eyes.\\n\\n“Parthiba, didn’t I tell earlier? You, my dear friends, have become sworn\\nenemies of each other. I am not blaming you. It’s the powers of the Pazhuvur\\nQueen. I have felt those powers myself. Parthiba and Kandhanmaran, you mount\\non your horses and ride slowly before us. Let me listen to the details of Vandhiya\\nThevan’s travels. We’ll be following you. I’ll enquire into your charges and find\\nout the truth. But remember one thing. You three have to be friends. There’s\\nnothing which can bring greater sorrow to me than you three fighting with each\\nother.”\\n\\n\\x0cParthibendra Pallavan and Kandhanmaran reluctantly mounted on their\\nrespective horses and started riding forward.\\n\\nAzhwarkkadian came near Vandhiya Thevan and whispered into his ears:\\n\\n“You have become very smart. You did not tell the truth. Nor did you lie. But\\nyou escaped from them.”\\n\\nAdithya Karikalan saw Azhwarkkadian only at that time.\\n\\n“Who is this? His face looks familiar to me.”\\n\\n“Yes, Your Highness. You have seen me a few years ago.”\\n\\n“Even your voice is familiar.”\\n\\n“Yes, Prince. You heard my voice at an important moment three years ago.”\\n\\nA black shadow spread across the face of the Crown Prince.\\n\\n“Important moment … .. … Three years back... What was that... Did I hear this\\n\\n\\x0cvoice when I was searching for the enemy in an island of the Vaigai River?”\\n\\n“Yes, Your Highness. That voice was mine. It was I who told you about the\\nenemy’s hiding place. I was hiding behind a tree when I spoke to you.”\\n\\n“What a horrible day it was! I was in a state of murderous frenzy. Even now if I\\nthink of that day, my body shivers. Vaishnavite, why were you hiding in the\\nforest on that day? Why didn’t you appear before me at that time?”\\n\\n“Your Highness just spoke about your murderous frenzy. You were killing\\neveryone who came on your way. And I wanted to live for some more time.”\\n\\n“Is that the only reason? I shouted several times requesting the disembodied\\nvoice to manifest before me. Even then you did not come.”\\n\\n“Because I did not want to earn the fury of my adopted sister who is at present\\nthe Queen of Pazhuvur.”\\n\\n“And you wanted me to earn her fury, right? Villain!”\\n\\nKarikalan unsheathed his sword. Vandhiya Thevan was afraid. He was sure that\\nAzhwarkkadian would be killed. He told the Crown Prince in a very soft voice.\\n\\n“Your Highness, this man has come from the Chief Minister. He has got a\\nmessage for you. Please get your message before punishing him.”\\n\\n\\x0c“What’s the use in punishing him? What’s the use in punishing anybody for that\\nmatter?”\\n\\nKarikalan put back the sword in its sheath.\\n\\nUnlike Vandhiya Thevan, Azhwarkkadian was unfazed by Karikalan’s anger. He\\nspoke to him with a strange smile on his face.\\n\\n“Your Highness, I know you’ll direct your anger towards me. That was why I\\navoided meeting you till now. My sister too is still angry with me. She refuses to\\nsee me now. But I now learn that she is no longer angry with you. You came to\\nthe feast at Kadambur Palace only after seeing her letter. Am I right, Your\\nHighness?”\\n\\n“Scoundrel! Wicked Vaishnava! How the hell do you know?”\\n\\n“I work for the Chief Minister. Nothing can happen in the Chozha Empire\\nwithout his knowledge.”\\n\\n“One day or other I’ll banish Anbil Aniruddha Brahmarayar and you from the\\nChozha Kingdom. Now you two mount on your horses. And ride on either side\\nof me. Let’s talk as we go. “\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 13 - The Secret in Manimekalai’s Heart\\n\\nNandini was reclining on a bed made of the softest feathers. She was in the\\nspecially decorated chamber at the Kadambur Palace. Nandini was draped in\\nluxurious silks. She wore the finest jewels. The beauty on her face was well\\nbeyond the reach of any known language. Her eyes were half-closed. She was\\nindulging in her most favourite pastime - day-dreaming. Whenever her eyes\\nopened fully, rays of lightning flashed from her large, beautiful eyes. On the\\nsurface it appeared if she was dozing; but her mind was hyper-active.\\n\\nIf somebody looked deep into her half-closed eyes they would find that they\\nfocused on the source of incense smoke. A mud pot was holding the incense\\npowder. Perfumed smoke came out of the pot and went up in circles and then\\nvanished into thin air. Nobody knew what Nandini saw in the weird shapes\\ncaused by the smoke.\\n\\nShe let out a long sigh. Her pearly lips murmured:\\n\\n“All my dreams have evaporated like the smoky incense circles. The smoke at\\nleast leaves a pleasant smell behind. My dreams will leave behind nothing but\\npain, grief, humiliation and disgrace.”\\n\\n“Devi, Devi... May I come in?”\\n\\nNandini heard the soft voice of Manimekalai.\\n\\n\\x0c“Please come. Why should you ask my permission to enter a room in your own\\nPalace?”\\n\\nManimekalai gently opened the door and walked in. It was true that she just\\nwalked. But with her face glowing with zeal and enthusiasm in her steps and in\\nthe movement of her hands, it appeared as if she was dancing her way into the\\nroom.\\n\\nNandini sat up. She pointed out to the ivory seat near her bed to Manimekalai.\\n\\nManimekalai sat down.\\n\\n“Devi, my brother has taught me how I should behave in your presence. He has\\nspoken a lot about the culture of the Southerners. Very specifically he has told\\nme that I should not enter anybody’s room without asking their permission first.”\\n\\n“Let the Southerners and their culture go to hell. Forget whatever your brother\\nhas taught you. And yes, don’t call me Devi or Queen. Never! Call me, Akka.”\\n\\n“Akka! Akka! Sounds very sweet! I hope you won’t mind my disturbing you\\nhere quite often.”\\n\\n“Yes, it’ll be a disturbance if you come every now and then. Instead if you opt to\\nstay here, there won’t be any disturbance at all.”\\n\\n\\x0cNandini’s smile was quite seductive. Manimekalai was bowled over by that\\nsmile. For a while she was staring at Nandini’s beautiful face.\\n\\n“I have never seen somebody half as beautiful as you, Akka. Not even in\\npaintings.”\\n\\n“Oh My God! Please don’t fall in love with me. Already the whole town is\\ncalling me a “Mayamohini” meaning the seducing witch. Any man who comes\\nnear me falls for me. That’s the charge against me. I don’t want you to add to my\\ncharges.”\\n\\n“Akka, if only I hear somebody talking like that I’ll cut off their tongues.”\\n\\n“There’s no point in blaming the whole town, Manimekalai. See I am married to\\nan old man. That makes their tongues wag.”\\n\\nManimekalai’s face fell.\\n\\n“Yes, Akka. I and my brother feel sorry about it. But that can never give\\nanybody any right to talk ill of you.”\\n\\n“Let them talk, Manimekalai. Even our Holy Mother Seetha Devi was not spared\\nfrom such gossip. But that’s not a loss to Seetha Devi. Ok, let’s not worry about\\nmy problems. Now tell me about you.”\\n\\n\\x0c“What’s there to tell, Akka?”\\n\\n“Cheat! Didn’t you tell me in the evening that you’d reveal what’s in your\\nheart?”\\n\\nNandini gently spanked Manimekalai’s cheeks.\\n\\n“Akka, I want to be with you for all my life. If they organise a Swayamvar for\\nme and give me the liberty to choose my life-partner and if women are allowed\\nto marry women, then I’ll garland you as my husband, Akka.”\\n\\n“Not even a whole day has passed since we met. And you have already started to\\ntalk like this. Well… I am happy in a way. I was longing for a dear friend like\\nyou for many, many years. The daughter’s of the Chieftains of Chozha Kingdom\\nfavour that devil in Pazhaiyaarai. I’ve at least got you. But whatever you said a\\nshort while ago can’t happen at all. A woman marrying a woman has never\\nhappened in this world. You’ll have to marry a man. You have no other option.”\\n\\n“What if I remain a virgin all my life, Akka?”\\n\\n“No, dear. The world won’t let you remain a virgin; neither your father nor your\\nbrother. They won’t rest till they marry you off to some man. Tell me who you\\nwant to marry, given a choice.”\\n\\n“Please give me some names, Akka. I’ll choose from them.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Ok. Will you marry Prince Madhuranthakan known for his devotion to Lord\\nShiva? Or marry the Crown Prince Adithya Karikalan noted for his great acts of\\nvalour?”\\n\\nManimekalai appeared to have been lost in thoughts and suddenly burst out\\nlaughing.\\n\\n“Why are you laughing, girl? Do you think that I am making fun of you? Your\\nbrother asked me to come here particularly to settle that issue. Adithya Karikalan\\nmight come here anytime. Your brother will be coming along with him. I have\\ngiven a promise to your brother that I’d tell him what’s in your heart.”\\n\\n“Even I do not know what’s there in my heart, Akka. What can I do?”\\n\\n“Tell me at least why you laughed.”\\n\\n“As soon as you mentioned Madhuranthakan’s name, something came to my\\nmind. Four months ago he came here. He travelled in the closed palanquin in\\nwhich you usually travel. We at the ladies’ chambers did not know this secret\\nswitch-over arrangement. We thought you had come in that palanquin. “Why\\nhasn’t the Pazhuvur Queen visited the ladies’ chambers yet?” - we were asking\\none another. Akka, didn’t you say a little while ago that a woman cannot marry\\nanother woman? My marrying Madhuranthakan would be a woman marrying a\\nwoman.”\\n\\nNandini smiled.\\n\\n\\x0c“Yes, I too thought that you won’t like Madhuranthakan. I told this to your\\nbrother. Madhuranthakan is already married to my brother-in-law’s daughter.\\nShe’s a very arrogant woman. You can’t live with her even for a single day. Then\\nit means that you have lost your heart to Prince Karikalan.”\\n\\n“No, Akka. I won’t say that. I have not seen him at all. How can I lose my heart\\nto him?”\\n\\n“Dear, women born in Royal families do not have the luxury of seeing the man\\nbefore losing their hearts to him. Have you not heard in stories and epics about\\nwomen who have lost their hearts to men after seeing them in paintings and after\\nhearing about their accomplishments?”\\n\\n“You are right, Akka. I too have heard. I have heard that Adithya Karikalan is\\none of the greatest warriors of our Kingdom and that his fame has spread all over\\nthe world. Akka, is it true that he cut off Veerapandiyan’s head in a single\\nstroke?”\\n\\nManimekalai failed to notice the terrifying change of expression on Nandini’s\\nface. Nandini looked away for a few seconds and then turned over to\\nManimekalai. By that time her face had resumed its usual seductive charm.\\n\\n“Manimekalai, do you think that beheading a person in a single stroke is an act\\nof valour? Isn’t that a terribly gruesome act?”\\n\\n“I don’t understand, Akka. Is it not valour to cut the head of the enemy? How\\ncan it be gruesome?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Imagine a situation like this. Somebody is dear to you. His enemy has come to\\nkill him. Think of your brother. Or, of the person, your beloved whom you want\\nto marry. And think of that person lying in bed. At that time somebody comes\\nwith a drawn sword to kill him. Will you praise the valour of the aggressor?”\\n\\nManimekalai thought for a while.\\n\\n“A strange question, Akka. Allow me to explain what appears in my little brain.\\nIf I am in that kind of a situation I won’t be a silent spectator, Akka. I’ll grab the\\nsword from the hands of the killer and kill him with his sword.”\\n\\nNandini hugged Manimekalai.\\n\\n“A very apt reply, my dear. I should now make sure that such an intelligent\\nwoman like you should get the right husband. I doubt even Adithya Karikalan\\nwill be a right match to you, my dear.”\\n\\n“I think so too, Akka. After knowing about Karikalan, I am only afraid of him.\\nCan I tell you what’s there in my heart?”\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 14 - Will Her Dream Come True?\\n\\nNandini held Manimekalai’s chin and lifted her face. She tried to look into her\\neyes which had blossomed fully in happiness.\\n\\n“Dear, its better that you do not open up your heart to me. We have hardly met.\\nNot even a whole day has passed since we came to know each other. You should\\nreveal what’s in your heart only to your old friends and not to strangers like me.”\\n\\n“No, Akka. For me it seems that I have known you for ages. My heart is keen on\\nsharing those things with you which I have not shared with anybody else. I feel I\\nam now bold enough to seek favours from you which I have not sought from\\nanyone.”\\n\\n“Then go ahead, my dear. Ask whatever you want.”\\n\\n“I have read about the concept of “apparition” in stories. Can it happen in real\\nlife? When somebody is not physically before us can we feel the person’s\\npresence?”\\n\\n“It happens at times. If our love for someone is so intense we can feel the\\nperson’s presence even though he may not be there. Paradoxically that happens\\neven if our hatred for a person is intense. Haven’t you heard of Lord Krishna’s\\nstories? You might have watched the plays as well. Kamsa hated Krishna. And\\nhe could see Krishna everywhere. He used to throw knives at the apparitions he\\nsaw and was disappointed every time. A milkmaid by name Nappinnai loved\\nKrishna. She used to see him everywhere. She would see the Lord in the pillars,\\n\\n\\x0cin the trees and even in the river. She would madly want to hug the Lord and\\nwould be disappointed. Now tell me Manimekalai, which Krishna seduced you\\nlike that?”\\n\\n“Akka, I saw him for the first time about four months ago. Even before that, my\\nbrother used to speak about him. I never saw him at that time. But after seeing\\nhim once, his form used to visit me in my dreams. Even during daytime I could\\nsee him standing before me.”\\n\\n“And you saw that magician’s apparition yesterday?”\\n\\n“You are right, Akka. But how did you know?”\\n\\n“Didn’t anybody tell you that I have magical powers?”\\n\\n“Yes, they have. But is it true, Akka?”\\n\\n“You can test me. Well, I’ll use my powers of magic to tell you which handsome\\nprince stole your heart. “\\n\\n“Come on, Akka! Please! I am too shy to tell his name.”\\n\\nNandini closed her eyes for a while and then opened them again.\\n\\n\\x0c“The man who heartlessly stole your heart hails from the Vaana clan. His full\\nname is Vallavaraiyan Vandhiya Thevan. Am I right?”\\n\\n“Oh My God! Akka, it’s true that you have powers of divination.”\\n\\n“Oh My silly girl! If you have lost your heart to somebody why don’t you tell\\nyour brother about him? Why should you lure Madhuranthakan? Or drag\\nAdithya Karikalan all the way here only to disappoint him?”\\n\\n“Akka, my brother Kandhanmaran does not like him.”\\n\\n“But in what way does that matter? Tell me, is your brother going to marry him?\\nBut didn’t you tell me that it was Kandhanmaran who first told you about\\nVandhiya Thevan? And it was your brother who brought him here.”\\n\\n“Yes, you are right. It was he who first spoke about him. It was he who brought\\nhim here. But then suddenly there was a change of mind. And there’s a reason\\nfor that as well. He stabbed my brother when they were in Thanjavur. And my\\nbrother was lying sick in your palace. And it was because you took good care of\\nhim that he came back to life.”\\n\\n“Your brother has this habit of exaggerating things. He was just staying in our\\nPalace. I didn’t do much. This is not the time to discuss that. What are you going\\nto do now? Your lover has become your brother’s avowed enemy.”\\n\\n“But do you know what he says?”\\n\\n\\x0c“”Who is this ‘He’ you are alluding to?”\\n\\n“It’s him, Akka. Please don’t tease me. You told his name a little while ago. He\\nswears that he never stabbed Kandhanmaran. Somebody had stabbed him and\\nhad left him bleeding near the walls of Thanjavur Fort. And then it was he who\\nsaved my brother.”\\n\\n“When did he tell that to you?”\\n\\n“Yesterday.”\\n\\n“Did you see Vandhiya Thevan yesterday? Didn’t you say that you only saw his\\napparition?”\\n\\n“That’s it, Akka. I am confused. I am not clear whether I saw him or his\\napparition. When I think back on what happened yesterday everything looks like\\na dream. They say if somebody dies their spirit will manifest as apparition and\\ntalk to us. Is it true, Akka?”\\n\\nWhen Manimekalai asked this question the fear in her voice was apparent.\\nNandini too shuddered in fear. She was staring pointlessly at the ceiling and\\nspoke in a distant voice.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s true. If someone died young their spirits would be hovering around\\nthose who are living. If they had been beheaded the head alone would appear at\\n\\n\\x0ctimes. At times the headless trunk would appear. And sometimes the head and\\nthe body will come separately pestering you, ‘Have you avenged my death\\nyet?’”\\n\\nAnd then she spoke aloud.\\n\\n“Silly girl! Why do you ask that question? Do you fear that something terrible\\nmust have happened to your lover? Who planted that doubt in your mind?”\\n\\n“There’s a person who deals with spirits in this palace. He’d be possessed by\\nspirits at times and would blurt out what’s happening in the world. I sent for him.\\nBut he had been beaten up by somebody. His wife, Devaratti, came in his stead.\\nAnd she told me all those things.”\\n\\n“Don’t believe those stupid things.”\\n\\n“No, Akka. I didn’t. If he had come as a mere spirit I could not have touched\\nhim.”\\n\\n“You can neither touch a spirit nor an apparition. Why are you telling that now?\\nDid you touch your lover yesterday?”\\n\\n“That’s where I am confused, Akka. I feel that I have touched him. But now\\nwhen I think of many other things I am not sure.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Tell me what happened yesterday. Don’t leave anything out. I’ll clear your\\ndoubts.”\\n\\n“Ok, Akka. If I jumble up things please stop me. Ask questions if you do not\\nunderstand, Akka. I was here in this place yesterday almost at the same time as\\nnow. I came here to check whether your room has been properly made according\\nthe strict instructions given by my brother. I was looking at my face in this\\nmirror.”\\n\\n“Oh, you were admiring your own beauty?”\\n\\n“No, Akka. I know about my face. Not worth looking at.”\\n\\n“Why are you so harsh on yourself? Your face is flawless. It will make the\\nGoddess of Love, Rathi Devi and the wife of the chief of gods, Indrani burn in\\njealousy.”\\n\\n“But they are not worth the dirt in your feet, Akka.”\\n\\n“Ok go ahead. You were looking your face in the mirror.”\\n\\n“Suddenly another face appeared in the mirror. It was very close to mine.”\\n\\n“Was that your lover’s face?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Yes! I was shocked!”\\n\\n“Why should you be shocked? Didn’t you say that you were seeing his face in\\nyour dreams quite often?”\\n\\n“Yes, I did. But there was a difference. In my dreams the face used to be at a\\ndistance. Same is the case when he comes as an apparition. But here... here... it\\nwas from behind..... I feel very shy... Akka… “\\n\\n“Naughty girl. Tell me exactly what happened.”\\n\\n“It appeared as if the face came to kiss me on my cheeks. I turned around in\\nshock. There was nobody there. Nor could I see the face in the mirror. I had a\\ndoubt. Do you remember the secret door from this room that leads to the\\nHunters’ Hall? I showed it to you. Yesterday the mirror was placed just opposite\\nto the door. I thought somebody must have opened the door from the Hunters’\\nHall and must have peeped out. I thought it was not possible. How can a stranger\\nenter that hall? Impossible! For whatever it was worth I opened the door and\\nwent into that hall.”\\n\\nNandini was very curious now.\\n\\n“Was the thief hiding in the Hunters’ Hall? Was he caught?”\\n\\n“Akka, why do you call him a thief?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Not in a derogatory sense, dear. Didn’t he steal your heart? I was referring to\\nthat. Tell me, was he in that hall?”\\n\\n“Surprise of surprises, Akka. He was not there. There was only our man\\nIdumban Kari who was cleaning the hall. His face resembled the gory face of\\nKaduvetti Karuppan a statue placed outside the Ayyanar temple. ‘Was anybody\\nelse here in this hall?’ I asked him. He insisted there was nobody other than him\\nin that hall.”\\n\\n“Do you think he would have lied?”\\n\\n“I don’t know, Akka. But I had a strong feeling that someone was hiding in the\\nhall. ‘Let the culprit come out on his own’, I thought and came back to this\\nroom.”\\n\\n“But did he come out?”\\n\\n“Please let me continue. After I came to this room I was listening for the sound\\nof people speaking in the Hunters’ Hall. Yes, I did hear some voices. I also heard\\nsomething falling down. When I was debating what to do, this door opened. I hid\\nthe lamp and was waiting. There is a small round door within this large door. A\\nfigure was trying to enter this room through that small door. “Danger! Danger!\\nPlease save me.” I heard somebody shouting. As the voice and the figure\\nresembled him I helped him through that small door. Then I rekindled the lamp.\\nYes, Akka. It was him!”\\n\\n\\x0c“Manimekalai, that’s a surprise. It looks like a page from the famous\\nVikramadithya Stories.”\\n\\n“I am not finished, Akka. When I first saw the person who had been very regular\\nin my dreams for the past four months, my heart skipped a beat. I became\\necstatic. But I feigned anger and talked to him in that tone.\\n\\n“How can you enter the ladies’ chambers like this?” I asked him. He told me he\\nwas being chased by somebody who wanted to kill him. “You are a coward. You\\nare afraid to die.” I teased him. He told me that he was not armed. I accused him\\nof back-stabbing my brother. ‘No. I never did that. I will never do that.’ He\\nswore, Akka.”\\n\\n“And you believed him?”\\n\\n“At that time he appeared credible. But when I think of the subsequent\\ndevelopments I am not very sure, Akka.”\\n\\n“What happened?”\\n\\n“As I was talking to him I was also listening to the sounds coming from the\\nHunters’ Hall. I could hear several people walking in the hall. And I could hear\\nmany people talking too. I then thought maybe he is telling the truth. And that\\nthese people were after him. My only concern at that time was to save him from\\ndanger, Akka. I wanted to know about the persons who were intent on killing\\nhim. I even suspected Idumban Kari. He could be an accomplice to the killers.\\nOr he could be an accomplice to this man. I wanted to know.\\n\\n\\x0c“I was also worried that so many people know about the secret passage from the\\nHunters’ Hall to this room. And when I realised that you will be staying in this\\nroom I was even more worried. I did not have the courage to send word to my\\nfather. If he came to know of his presence he will be killed. So I asked him to\\nstay here and went back to the Hunters’ Hall to see who else was there. There\\nwere five or six of them. They were all in the corner of the hall huddling close to\\nthe wall. They were shocked on seeing me. I too was afraid of them. I drove\\naway my fears and wanted to ask about the strangers in an angry voice. By that\\ntime my friend Chandramathi came to this room looking for me. She was calling\\n“Amma... Amma...”\\n\\n“Only then I remembered that he was alone in the room. I was afraid that\\nChandramathi might see him and scream. I returned to this room making a\\nmental note to go back to the Hunters Hall later in the day. By that time this man\\nhad vanished without a trace.\\n\\n“Did you see anybody here?” I asked my friend. She had not seen anybody. I\\nsearched for him and then unable to find him I went back to the Hunters’ Hall.\\nNobody whom I saw earlier was there. Idumban Kari was the only person in the\\nhall. He was busy with his cleaning work. “What happened to those who were\\nhere sometime ago? Who were they?” I asked Idumbankari.\\n\\n“Nobody came here, Your Highness.” He kept on insisting. I could not believe\\nhim. My friend Chandramathi started teasing me. “Akka, something has\\nhappened to you. I think you’ve gone crazy. You are seeing people who are not\\nthere.”\\n\\nThen she told me that you people have reached the gates of our Fort. And that,\\nmy father wanted me to receive you. So I left for the Palace gates. To reach the\\ngates faster I took two flights of stairs up and reached the terrace. As I was\\n\\n\\x0cwalking on the terrace I saw something strange. The warrior from the Vaana clan\\nwas walking in the back yard of the palace along the wall. I even saw him\\njumping the wall using a bamboo pole. Yes, that was how it appeared to my\\neyes. Did it really happen or did I hallucinate, I do not know.”\\n\\nNandini was lost in thoughts. The two faces she saw in the midst of the thick\\nforest growth just outside the Palace appeared in her mind. She knew that\\nhorsemen had been sent to capture those two people. Would they have been\\ncaptured by now? And if they were, would they be brought here?\\n\\n“What do you think, Akka?”\\n\\nManimekalai’s words broke her reverie.\\n\\n“Me? Are you asking me? Well, I think that you are now madly in love.”\\n\\n“Are you teasing me like my friend Chandramathi?”\\n\\n“No, my dear girl. I’ll be the last person to make fun of your love. It was you\\nwho saw him. Even you can’t tell whether it was real, or a dream or a\\nhallucination. How can I tell, my dear? Is there any secret way to get out of this\\nroom?”\\n\\n“As far as I know, there is none, Akka.”\\n\\n\\x0c“He could have gone the same way used by you and Chandramathi.”\\n\\n“There were several maids on the way. He could not have gone without their\\nknowledge.”\\n\\n“Quite surprising! Did you tell your father about this? “\\n\\n“No, Akka. I didn’t. I am a little shy. I am also afraid, Akka. If he had really\\ncome here... “\\n\\n“You are right. Its better you don’t tell these things to men. They won’t\\nunderstand.”\\n\\n“I am debating whether I should tell my brother or not.”\\n\\n“If you tell him it will become a big issue. He wants you to marry Karikalan at\\nany cost.”\\n\\n“You will have to help me, Akka. Kandhanmaran is devoted to you. If you tell\\nhim he won’t refuse… Please... Akka... “\\n\\n“Oh My God! You are making me work against the very purpose of my visit.\\nYou are a very smart girl. Assuming that your marriage to Karikalan is dropped\\nwe are not sure about the other person. You don’t know what’s in his mind.\\nWhat’s the guarantee that he’d marry you?”\\n\\n\\x0c“I am not bothered about that, Akka. Even if he doesn’t like me... “\\n\\n“That’s the fate of women. Whatever men do women have to love them and even\\ngive up their lives for them. That’s the rule. Let’s see your luck. If something\\nlike what happened yesterday happens now you should tell me. Will you?”\\n\\n“Who else can I tell, Akka? I had a dream yesterday. Want to share that with\\nyou.”\\n\\n“In addition to day-dreaming you also dream in the night. What was that again?\\nDid he come again in the dream to deceive you?”\\n\\n“No, Akka. This is something different. And quite frightening too. They say that\\nif you dream in the wee hours of morning it’s likely to happen. Is that true,\\nAkka?”\\n\\n“First tell me your dream. Did you dream about somebody else?”\\n\\n“No, Akka. About the same man. I saw somebody was about to stab him. He\\nwas unarmed. But there was a shining sword lying on the floor. I grabbed the\\nsword and pounced on the killer. I was about to stab the killer. Only then did I\\nsee his face. He was my brother Kandhanmaran. I screamed and woke up. I was\\nbathed in sweat. I was shivering. Though it was a dream it seemed like real. If it\\ncomes true..... Oh My God!”\\n\\n\\x0c“Oh my dear! You are really confused. Whatever was real looks like an illusion\\nto you. Whatever was a dream looks like real to you. What a friend I have got! If\\nI am crazy, you are crazier still.”\\n\\nChandramathi came in at that time.\\n\\n“They are on the way. We have got news that they have crossed the\\nVeeranarayana Lake.”\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 15 - The Royal Hospitality\\n\\nThe gates of the Kadambur Sambuvaraiyar Palace witnessed a miracle on that\\nday. To the point eyes could see the place was filled with people. There were\\nmen, women, children and even aged people in that crowd.\\n\\nThose old men and women who could not stand on their own used the support of\\ncanes to stand near the Palace gates. . They were so anxious to see the valiant\\nface of Adithya Karikalan that they did not mind being shoved around by the\\njostling crowd. The children did not mind being squeezed by the crowd. They\\nused all their energies to move further up in the crowd and go near the gates.\\nYoung women forgot their traditional sense of shame. They did not mind being\\npushed and touched by strangers and were trying to move forward. Young men\\non the other hand did not pay heed to those young women but were keen on\\ncapturing vantage points from which they could have a better view of the\\nvisiting Royalty, the Crown Prince. Many young men had even climbed up the\\ntrees standing near and opposite to the Kadambur Palace. Others even risked\\nclimbing up the outer walls of the palace and were pushed down by the security\\nguards.\\n\\nThere were many young mothers balancing their infants on their hips waiting for\\na glimpse of the Crown Prince. To be in the midst of such a jostling crowd was\\nan unmitigated suffering for them. Yet they were cooing to their dear ones,\\n“Please don’t cry, dear. The greatest warrior of the Tamilnadu, the one who\\nbeheaded Veerapandiyan, the one and only Adithya Karikalan is about to pass\\nthrough before our eyes. If you happen to see him once one day you may also\\nbecome a warrior like him.” In the same way the lovers were pacifying their\\nbeloved, and mothers, their children.\\n\\nAdithya Karikalan’s fame had spread throughout the kingdom. Who would not\\n\\n\\x0cbe keen to see the person who stepped into the battlefield at the age of twelve,\\nthe one who wielded the sword at such a young age and killed many an enemy,\\nthe one who crushed the Pandya forces at the Sevur battlefield and made the\\nPandya King Veerapandiyan flee to a desert and hide himself in a cave, the one\\nwho at his 19th year of age broke through the personal bodyguards of\\nVeerapandiyan, found out his place of hiding and brought his head back as a\\nwar-souvenir?\\n\\nOf course there were several rumours concerning the Crown Prince; most of\\nthem gained strength during the last three, four years. It was rumoured that after\\nAdithya Karikalan was designated as the Crown Prince he broke off with his\\nfather Sundara Chozhan and that the old emperor did not want him to ascend the\\nthrone after him.\\n\\nIn the past, a Chozha Prince who had ruled over Kanchi soon started the great\\nPallava dynasty. According to another rumour doing rounds- the Crown Prince\\nalso wanted to start a new dynasty in Kanchi. Some said that Adithya Karikalan\\nwas put off by the special love the Emperor had for his younger son\\nArulmozhivarman. Others violently denied such rumours and insisted that it was\\nrare to see such loving brothers like Karikalan and Arulmozhivarman.\\n\\nThere were also rumours about Karikalan still remaining unmarried. It was\\nrumoured that the Crown Prince refused to marry King’s daughters and insisted\\non marrying a priest’s daughter and making her his queen. And that was the\\nreason for the stand-off between the son and the father, the rumour-mongers\\nexplained.\\n\\nAnother set of rumours went on a different line. That the Crown Prince had lost\\nhis mind thanks to some wicked spell cast by the evil sorcerers of the Pandya\\nKingdom and it was precisely for that reason that the Chieftains of the Chozha\\nEmpire did not want him to succeed the Emperor.\\n\\n\\x0cWhatever may be the rumours people were dying to see the Crown Prince. Even\\nas the news spread that he was going to visit the Kadambur Palace it created a\\nstorm in the vicinity. When it was confirmed that the Prince was going to come\\nto the palace that evening people from all the villages in the radius of twenty\\nmiles had assembled to see him.\\n\\nThe words coming from thousands of mouths lost their meanings and became\\nthe meaningless roar of a sea in turbulence.\\n\\nThe security guards had cleared the way for the Prince and his retinue near the\\nPalace gates. As people pushed those in the front they in turn moved forward\\nblocking the way reserved for the Prince. The guards shoved them away to clear\\nthe way. This back and forth action too resembled the waves in the ocean.\\n\\nAperson standing on the top branch of a tree shouted. “They are coming!”\\n\\n“Where? Where?” - A thousand voices shouted in unison. A horse came running\\nat full speed. To avoid being trodden by the horse people moved quickly to give\\nway.\\n\\n“The Sambuvaraiyar Prince” - they recognised the horse-rider. Yes,\\nKandhanmaran had come. He did not answer the anxious question posed to him\\nby the people. He rode fast till the Palace gate and then dismounted.\\n\\nHe saw Sambuvaraiyar and Pazhuvettaraiyar standing there. He bowed to them\\nand told them almost in a whisper.\\n\\n\\x0c“The Crown Prince is coming. But he is not in his moods. Very short tempered. I\\nrode ahead only to caution you. Let us accord a Royal reception to him. Even if\\nhe were to utter something unpleasant let’s not mind it. Let’s not even respond to\\nit.”\\n\\nHe then looked up at the terrace. He saw the women of the Royal household\\nwaiting in the terrace of the first tower. He then entered the fort and climbed up\\nthe stairs to the terrace.\\n\\nAs soon as he reached the terrace his eyes avoided all others and sought Nandini.\\nHe went near her.\\n\\n“Devi, I’ve delivered on my promise. I have brought the Prince with me. There\\nhe is. But as of now he behaves like a mad elephant. I don’t know how we are\\ngoing to manage him.”\\n\\n“Why do you worry about that? What do you need to control a mad elephant? A\\ngoad, right? You have two, in the form of your sister’s beautiful eyes. So there is\\nno need to worry.”\\n\\nManimekalai squealed.\\n\\n“Akka, what’s this?”\\n\\nKandhanmaran responded to his sister:\\n\\n\\x0c“Manimekalai, there’s nothing wrong in what the Pazhuvur Queen says. One\\nshould have done penance to have somebody like Adithya Karikalan as one’s\\nhusband.”\\n\\nBefore Manimekalai could answer Nandini intervened.\\n\\n“Is somebody else coming along with the Prince?”\\n\\n“Yes, Parthibendra Pallavan and Vandhiya Thevan are coming along.”\\n\\nNandini threw a pointed glance at Manimekalai and asked Kandhanmaran:\\n\\n“Which Vandhiya Thevan? You said you have a friend by that name? Is that\\nhim?”\\n\\n“Yes, the true friend who tried to back-stab me. He jumped from nowhere and\\njoined us at the banks of River Vellaru. I am putting up with him only for the\\nsake of the Prince. Otherwise I would have made him a prey to my sword.”\\n\\nManimekalai’s face fell.\\n\\n“Anna, if it’s true that he tried to stab you, why should we let him inside our\\npalace?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Don’t poke your nose into the men’s affairs, dear. They’ll fight with each other\\ntoday; and then become thick friends tomorrow. That’s their way of life.”\\n\\nKandhanmaran smiled.\\n\\n“It’s not like that. I just said that I had to overlook that because of the Prince. Oh,\\nyou have got so many baskets of flowers! If you shower the flowers on the\\nPrince his tempers will cool and he’ll be his usual cool self. See there, they have\\ncome. Let me go down to receive them.”\\n\\nKandhanmaran ran through the steps.\\n\\nSeen from that terrace it appeared as if there was a raging ocean of people and in\\na particular spot there was a swirl. And the three horsemen appeared like a boat\\ncaught in that swirl of current. The next moment they were covered by the sea of\\npeople. The ‘swirl’ travelled further and reached the gates of the palace.\\n\\nThe three horsemen were the Crown Prince, Vandhiya Thevan and Parthibendra\\nPallavan. The elephants, horses and infantry were blocked by the crowd far away\\nfrom the gates. Their horses stopped at the gates. The band started to play. There\\nwere twenty drums, two hundred trumpets, about three hundred thara, a\\npercussion instrument and five hundred little drums. The sound coming from the\\nband silenced the crowd. After a while the band stopped playing. The herald\\nseized the opportunity, climbed up the platform and roared in a thunderous\\nvoice:\\n\\n\\x0c“Manumanthatha born in the Surya clan! The great emperor Sibi born of the\\nsame clan, the man who gave his flesh to save the life of a dove, Rajakesari who\\nwas born after Sibi, His son, Parakesari, the great Manuneethi Chozhan who\\nsacrificed his own son in order to render justice to a cow in his Kingdom,\\nKarikal Peruvalavan who made the Tiger Flag fly high in the Himalayas,\\nNalankilli, Nedunkilli, Perunarkilli, Kulamutrathu Thunjia Killi Valavan,\\nKurappalli Thunjia Killivalavan, Koperunchozhar, who established 72 temples\\nfor Lord Shiva, the great one who came on this line of Kings who bore ninety\\nand six wounds on his body, Pazhaiyaarai Vijayaalaya Chozhan, His son, the one\\nwho established 82 temples for Lord Shiva on the banks of River Cauvery from\\nSasya Hills to the city of Poompuhar, His son, the one who vanquished Madurai\\nand Lanka and the one who build the Golden Hall at Thillai Chidambaram\\nTemple, Emperor Paranthaka Chozha, His son, the One who defeated the forces\\nof the Kannara Thevan of the Twin Provinces, and the one who died in Aatroor,\\nthe valiant Arinjaya Chozhan, His son, the who has brought the region from\\nLanka to Cheetpuli Country under one rule, Emperor Pazhaiyaarai Paranthaka\\nSundara Chozhan, His first born, the Crown Prince, the Head of the Armed\\nForces of the Kingdom In the North, the one who beheaded Veerapandiyan,\\nAdithya Karikalan comes here! Parak! Parak!”\\n\\nWhen the person finished heralding the visit of the Crown Prince it appeared as\\nif the rains had just stopped.\\n\\nAnother herald standing near him now started:\\n\\n“The King of Kolli Hills, the man who by a single arrow could kill a lion, a bear,\\na deer, a boar - The warrior Valvil Ori - the One who was born in his clan, the\\nKing of Kings, the Warrior of Warriors, the Brave and Majestic - Sambuvaraiyar\\n- the one who is an eternal friend to the Chozha Emperor, the One who guards\\nthe Veeranarayana Lake - the one who heads five-thousand strong army, the\\nSambuvaraiyar begs of the Crown Prince Adithya Karikalan, with all his heart\\nand soul that He be pleased to visit his small palace and grace Him! May the\\nvisit of the Chozha Prince bring auspiciousness to all!”\\n\\n\\x0cOnce the heralding was over the women in the terrace showered flowers on the\\nvisitors. Adithya Karikalan and Vandhiya Thevan looked up. There amongst\\nmany beautiful faces Vandhiya Thevan could only see the fully blossomed face\\nof Manimekalai. Forgetting himself he smiled at her. Only then he realised his\\nmistake and turned around to look at the other side.\\n\\nAdithya Karikalan’s face now showed greater signs of irritation. He jumped off\\nfrom the horse. The other two also dismounted. The band started playing again.\\nThe people who remained silent till then started shouting. The guests and hosts\\nentered the Fort. The gates were then closed with a big noise.\\n\\nThe sound of the gates closing distracted the Crown Prince.\\n\\n“Why should they close the doors in such a hurry? Are they planning to imprison\\nme inside this Fort, as they have imprisoned my father in Thanjavur? What will\\nhappen to my retinue?”\\n\\nThe two old men - Sambuvaraiyar and Pazhuvettaraiyar - were stunned.\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar managed a smile and spoke to him in a sweet voice.\\n\\n“Prince, your father and you are forever imprisoned in the loving hearts of the\\nmillions of people of this Kingdom. How can anyone imprison you otherwise?”\\n\\nSambuvaraiyar added:\\n\\n\\x0c“Prince, if all those who have come to see you enter this palace what will\\nhappen? Even when they were standing outside the orchards and gardens around\\nthe Palace have gone waste as if run over by an army of unruly monkeys. Once\\nthe people go away we will safely bring in your retinue to the Palace. Till such\\ntime we have organized an army of men to take care of your personal needs,\\nPrince.”\\n\\nBy that time the noise made by the people outside the Fort increased. Karikalan\\nasked Kandhanmaran, “Show me the way to the terrace.”\\n\\nKandhanmaran pointed out to the stairs. Karikalan almost ran to them.\\nKandhanmaran, Parthibendra Pallavan and Vandhiya Thevan ran behind him.\\n\\nSambuvaraiyar could not hold himself any longer.\\n\\n“What’s this? I think we have unnecessarily brought in a terrible nuisance. I\\ndon’t think he is of the right mind. We have listened to youngsters and have\\ninvited disaster on ourselves.”\\n\\n“Don’t worry. Nothing will happen. Either our plans will succeed. Or will not.\\nWho bothers?” - Pazhuvettaraiyar was calm and collected.\\n\\n“I am not concerned about our plans. If something happens when he stays here\\nthen I’ll be in trouble. The omens and signs are not good. And the Crown Prince\\nlooks like a mad elephant. Did you see the irritation on his face? And the\\nstinging poison in his words?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Yes, I did. I guess we may have to grin and bear it for a few days. That\\nParthibendra Pallavan will help us rein him in. There’s another young man who\\nhas come along. I hate him. I have a doubt that he is a spy. He was there when\\nwe first had our meeting here. He was the one hiding behind the tree yesterday\\nevening.”\\n\\n“Oh, he is my son’s friend. Let’s not worry about him. Why are they running to\\nthe ladies’ side? Should we also go?”\\n\\nBy this time Parthibendra Pallavan who had gone with the other two till the\\nstairs had come back. He came near the two old men. He could hear the last\\nwords spoken by Sambuvaraiyar.\\n\\n“Your Highness can doubt the Crown Prince in any other department. But not\\nregarding women. He never looks at women.”\\n\\n“Then how will our plan work?” Pazhuvettaraiyar asked him.\\n\\n“Well that depends on Sambuvaraiyar’s luck and the Chozha Empire’s luck.”\\n\\n“Parthibendra, let’s forget Manimekalai’s luck. Why should the Prince come\\nwith this kind of an irritation? Why should he talk in that venomous tone? My\\nonly prayer to you is that somehow you should take him back from here without\\nany incident.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Till we reached the banks of River Vellaru, the Prince was cheerful and cordial.\\nAnd then this Vandhiya Thevan and another Vaishnavite came in. They must\\nhave told him something. From then on the Prince’s face has become like this.”\\n\\n“We thought so. Now tell me what can we do now? That trouble-maker young\\nman has also come with you... “\\n\\n“Be a little more patient. I’ll take care of everything. I have a score to settle with\\nthat young man. I am looking for the right time.”\\n\\nWhen Karikalan and the two men reached the terrace the women were coming\\ndown the steps.\\n\\nKarikalan spoke to Kandhanmaran.\\n\\n“Friend, how can you make these mothers wait for us? It’s not right. We should\\ngo to their place to pay our respects to them.”\\n\\nHe kept his hands folded and let the women pass on the stairs. As every woman\\nwalked past him he asked Kandhanmaran about her. When it was Nandini’s turn\\nKarikalan explained, “Oh it’s my little grandmother from Pazhuvur! Oh, has she\\nreally come? I am very happy.”\\n\\nNandini did not respond. But only glanced daggers at him with here sharp eyes.\\nKarikalan’s body shuddered due to the intensity of her glance. The next minute\\nKarikalan gathered himself and started teasing Manimekalai who was tagging\\n\\n\\x0calong.\\n\\n“Oh, this must be your sister Manimekalai. She looks like a painting of a\\ncelestial woman. We should find a proper groom for her.”\\n\\nManimekalai’s cheeks became red. There were dimples in her cheeks. She saw\\nVandhiya Thevan through the corner of her eyes and started climbing down the\\nstairs pretty fast.\\n\\nAfter all the women had left the place Karikalan climbed up the terrace. The\\npeople who had just started to disburse became excited and started hailing him.\\nThey started coming back to the gates of the Fort.\\n\\nKarikalan saw the herald standing alone in a raised platform very close to the\\nterrace. He signalled him to come near him. When he did he ordered him to\\nmake some announcements to the people on his behalf.\\n\\nThe herald went back to his place and beat his drums. He repeated some of the\\nachievements of Karikalan and then spoke in a loud voice:\\n\\n“And that Prince Adithya Karikalan will stay in this Kadambur Palace for a\\nweek or ten days. He will be visiting the surrounding villages as well. He will be\\nmeeting the people and would receive petitions from them.”\\n\\nThat did it. Whatever the noise the crowd had been making hitherto appeared\\nrelatively as perfect silence. The noise reached the sky. The sound of people\\n\\n\\x0capplauding their prince, hailing him and the sheer excitement in their voice rose\\nup in the air and spread to the vicinity even submerging the sound of water going\\nthrough the seventy four canals of the Veeranarayanapuram Lake.\\n\\nSambuvaraiyar, Pazhuvettaraiyar and Parthibendra Pallavan were standing in the\\nsame place. Karikalan came back from the terrace and went near them. He talked\\nto Parthibendran:\\n\\n“What happened to you Parthibendra? Why are you stuck up here? By any\\nchance have you too started to conspire with these old men?”\\n\\nThe old men were shocked. They saw the handsome face of the Prince. He was\\nnow sporting an innocent smile.\\n\\nSambuvaraiyar gathered himself to speak:\\n\\n“My Lord, you told a little while ago that you were imprisoned here. Now you\\nare talking about conspiracy. I swear, My Lord, that during your stay here in my\\nhut you will be absolutely safe and nothing will happen to you. And if it did my\\nlife would have left my body before that.”\\n\\n“Do you think I am afraid of the danger that might happen here? Even while I\\nwas in the midst of hundred thousand enemies in the Pandya Kingdom I never\\nthought about my safety nor did I worry about my life. Then why should I fear\\nwhen I am in the midst of my close friends? But please do not call this palace a\\nhut. Oh My God! How tall are the walls! How strong! The walls are bigger than\\nthose in Thanjavur Fort. Tell me this, what kind of enemies did you have in mind\\nbefore designing such strong walls?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Prince, we do not have any enemies. Anybody who is an enemy to the Chozha\\nKingdom is our enemy. Anybody who is a friend to the Chozhas is our friend.”\\n\\n“Your words make me very happy. I request you to share them with your son\\nKandhanmaran. For he sees my friend the Prince of Vaana clan Vandhiya\\nThevan as his enemy. Is that not a great blunder?”\\n\\nKandhanmaran hung down his head.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 16 - Malaiyaman’s Worry\\n\\nThere was a huge yard in the Sambuvaraiyar Palace between the Palace and the\\ncompound wall. While Kandhanmaran was leading the way Karikalan walked\\nbehind him looking around quite often. The other four men followed him.\\n\\nThey reached the place where a podium and a shamiana had been erected for\\nKuravai Koothu.\\n\\n“Oh, God! What is this? What’s going to happen here?” - Karikalan asked.\\n\\n“My Lord, if you so desire, we plan to have Kuravai Koothu here.”\\n\\n“Very good. You can have Kuravai Koothu. You can have Villupattu as well.\\nYou can enact plays depicting the lives of Karikal Valavan and Vijayaalaya\\nChozhan. We’ll spend our mornings in the forest hunting wild animals. We’ll\\nspend the nights in singing, dancing and drama. Sambuvaraiyar, do you know\\nwhat my grandfather Malaiyaman told me? ‘Don’t sleep in the night,’ he\\ncautioned me. I told him - “Grandfather, I don’t sleep in the day. Nor do I sleep\\nin the night. It has been three full years since I have had a good sleep. So you\\nneed not fear that my enemies will kill me while I am sleeping. Yes, they can\\nharm me while I am awake. But there is no man in this world bold enough to do\\nthat.” This is how I consoled my grandfather.\\n\\nKarikalan then started laughing loudly.\\n\\n\\x0cSambuvaraiyar’s voice trembled in anger. “My Lord, whether you sleep or\\nremain awake, so long as you are here in this palace no one can harm you.”\\n\\n“Yes, Yes. Who the hell can hurt me in this Sambuvaraiyar’s Palace? Can\\nanybody cross these high walls and enter the palace? Even the Lord of Death\\ncannot come. The Lord of Death is afraid of Kadambur Sambuvaraiyar. I just\\nshared the baseless fears of the old man from Thirukkovilur, my grandfather, I\\nmean. See, he has become very old. Some men tend to lose their courage with\\nthe onset of old age. Now take a look at my Pazhuvur Grandfather. How majestic\\nis his walk! Can anyone say that he has crossed sixty years of age?”\\n\\nKarikalan smiled.\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar badly wanted to give a retort. He cleared his throat. The noise\\nresembled the roar of a lion.\\n\\n“See, when the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar clears his throat the whole world\\ntrembles in fear. Kandhamara, Vandhiya Theva, Parthibendra! Just think! Will\\nyou be half as strong as him at his age? Perhaps you may clear your throats like\\nhe does. But you will never bring a new girl to your harem at his age.\\n\\n“Thatha! It appears that you have brought your Junior Queen along with you. I\\nsaw her in the terrace. Tell me this, Thatha. How did she travel? In a closed\\npalanquin? Or in an open chariot? Or in a cart?”\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar could not hold himself any longer.\\n\\n\\x0c“I brought her along on the top of the elephant. I wanted the whole world to\\nknow.”\\n\\n“That’s the way, Thatha! Let her travel in the same way hereafter. Don’t bring\\nher in a closed palanquin. That gives rise to many juicy rumours. Just listen to\\nthis. At times my uncle Madhuranthakan uses the Junior Queen’s closed\\nPalanquin to go places. That rumour has spread throughout the country.”\\n\\nKarikalan’s laugh resembled the sound of a thunder.\\n\\nNobody else laughed. Everyone was concerned in his own way.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan bit his tongue. ‘Oh My God! I have done the greatest blunder\\nof my life! I have disclosed everything to this crazy man. Looks like he is going\\nto share everything with these people.’ Vandhiya Thevan was worried.\\n\\nThe Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s mind was like a volcano about to erupt. There was\\nfire and smoke. And before the fire and lava escaped out of the volcano it boiled\\ninside creating a roaring sound when he cleared his throat.\\n\\nBefore he could talk, Parthibendran came forward.\\n\\n“My Lord! It has been only for a short time that I know the Junior Queen of\\nPazhuvur. But within that short time I came to know how devoted a woman she\\nis. She is like a goddess when it comes to chastity, my Lord. If anybody ventures\\nto comment on her I’ll make that man a victim to my sword. This is a promise,\\n\\n\\x0cmy Lord.”\\n\\nKandhanmaran came forward next.\\n\\n“I need not have to draw a sword. Anybody who talks ill of the Junior Queen of\\nPazhuvur will be killed by my bare hands. That’s a promise, my Lord.”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan was not to be left behind.\\n\\n“Same is the case with me. If anybody talks ill of the Pazhuvur Queen I’ll kill\\nhim with my mere looks.”\\n\\n“Aha! Wait, my dear friends. Looks like you’ll even pick up a fight with me.\\nThatha, did you see, how these people are anxious to protect the good name of\\nthe Tamil woman. But let me make myself clear. Nobody has spoken ill of the\\nJunior Queen of Pazhuvur. And if anybody did I won’t keep quiet. I won’t even\\nwait till these warriors come to finish off the person. People are not talking ill of\\nthe Pazhuvur Queen but only of her closed palanquin. That coward\\nMadhuranthakan uses it to go from one town to another. He uses it for his secret\\ntrips. When a man uses that closed palanquin covering the sides with screens and\\nthe Queen too travels in the same way it might give rise to a scandal.”\\n\\n“My Lord, why should the grandson of Emperor Paranthaka and the son of\\nKandaraathithar, Madhuranthakan travel in a closed palanquin? I don’t\\nunderstand.” - Parthibendra Pallavan said.\\n\\n\\x0c“The reasons are funny. Madhuranthakan goes to every town in Tamilnadu in\\nthat palanquin and is gathering support for his side.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Why? To ascend the great Chozha throne after my father. Isn’t it funny? A few\\nmonths ago he visited this same Kadambur Palace in a closed palanquin. There\\nwas a meeting of conspirators at mid-night. Parthibendra, the old man of\\nThirukkovilur, told me all these things only in your presence. Madhuranthakan is\\nnow anxious to become the Chozha King at the earliest. My grandfather is even\\nafraid that in his anxiety he might even pack off my father to the other world\\nearlier than his time. Don’t you remember all those things?”\\n\\n“Yes, Prince. I do remember. I never believed those things even when he told\\nthem. Nor do I believe them now. Its better that you visit Thanjavur and see your\\nfather. Then.... “\\n\\n“Not only you, but even I didn’t believe it. Otherwise do you think I’d have\\ncome as a guest to Kadambur Palace?”\\n\\nKarikalan thought about something and laughed.\\n\\nKadambur Sambuvaraiyar cleared his throat and spoke.\\n\\n“My Lord, you know very well about the enmity between our clan and that of\\nThirukkovilur Malaiyaman.”\\n\\n\\x0c“I know. The Sangam Poets have composed songs on that enmity. Malaiyaman\\nThirumudikkari killed Valvil Ori of Kolli Hills in a war. You all belong to the\\nValvil Ori clan. So you are not in good terms with Thirukkovilur.”\\n\\n“My Lord, Valvil Ori’s death was avenged immediately thereafter. Adhiyaman\\nNedumananchi, a close relative of Valvil Ori, invaded Thirukkovilur and\\ndestroyed that town. He also razed the Mullur Hill Fort of Malaiyaman to the\\nground.”\\n\\n“Sambuvaraiyar, Adhiyaman did not do that all by himself. He sought the help\\nof our ancestor Chozhan Killi Valavan. He could vanquish Malaiyaman only\\nwith his help. But what’s the need to dig up those old stories?”\\n\\n“We have been trying to forget the past; but Malaiyaman never lets us to. He has\\nbeen accusing us of something or the other.”\\n\\n“Didn’t I tell you? Malaiyaman has become old. And hence has become senile. I\\nam now concerned that he should not come with a huge army while I am here.\\nHe is too worried about my safety here.”\\n\\n“Prince, if you have any doubt... “\\n\\nSambuvaraiyar was lost for words.\\n\\n“Doubt? No way. Our relationship with Malaiyaman has been for only two\\n\\n\\x0cgenerations. But our relationship with the Pazhuvettaraiyars has been for six\\ngenerations. Pazhuvur King is here with us. Am I that crazy to think that he’ll do\\nanything against the Chozha clan?”\\n\\nKarikalan’s laugh was that of a mad man.\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar spoke in a majestic voice.\\n\\n“Prince, I won’t do anything against the Chozha clan. That’s a promise. I won’t\\ndo anything against fairness and justice. My second promise is two times\\nstronger than the first. . ”\\n\\n“Yes, there is something called justice and fairness. I’ve come to discuss that\\nwith you. If we have some time left after hunting and drama we’ll discuss\\nfairness and justice. Sambuvaraiyar, have you got the rooms ready for me and\\nmy friends in this great palace?”\\n\\n“Your Highness, I’ve made the entire Guest Chambers in the back row ready for\\nyou and the Pazhuvettaraiyars. I’ll make the other chieftains stay in the front\\nrooms.”\\n\\n“Oh more chieftains are going to come?”\\n\\n“Yes, Prince. All the Chieftains in the vicinity want to see you.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Let them come. Good. Let’s us sit down and discuss. And decide. Let’s try to\\ncome to a decision. Let Madhuranthakan’s conspiracy be there. I plan to have a\\nconspiracy with you all. There is no place more ideal for that than this Palace.”\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 17 - Poonkuzhali’s Heart\\n\\nPoonkuzhali’s small boat was gliding through the waters of the canal that went\\nall the way from Nagapattinam to Kodikkarai. Chendan Amudhan was on board\\nwith her. The boat was nearing Kodikkarai. The banks of the canal strongly\\nsmelled of golden hued screw pine flowers that had just blossomed. A parrot\\nalighted on a screw pine flower. The flower could not bear the weight of the bird\\nand it swayed. The parrot too swayed along with the flower and then plucked the\\npetals with its pearly nose.\\n\\nAs soon as the boat came near the parrot screeched and flew away.\\n\\n“If there’s another birth I want to be born as a parrot.” - Poonkuzhali.\\n\\n“That’s your thinking, Poonkuzhali. But we do not know about its pains, its\\nproblems and its sorrows.” - Chendan Amudhan.\\n\\n“Whatever may be its problems it can fly in the boundless sky anytime it wants.\\nWhat can give greater happiness than the freedom to fly in the high skies?”\\n\\n“But some people cage these parrots!”\\n\\n“Yes, they do. The princesses living in the palaces keep the parrots in cages.\\nHeartless devils. They cage the parrots and then play with them. If only I were a\\nmaid in any of these palaces I’ll give poison to the caged parrots and kill them\\n\\n\\x0call. And then I’ll feed poison to the princesses and kill them as well.”\\n\\n“If somebody hears your words you’ll also be branded as a heartless devil.”\\n\\n“Let them. I’d rather be a devil than a princess.”\\n\\n“Why do you hate the princesses, Poonkuzhali? In a way they too deserve our\\nsympathy. Their fate is no different from those caged parrots. They are caged\\nwithin their palaces and spend their whole lives there. And if only they had to\\nstep out of their palaces... Oh My God! How many security restrictions! How\\nmany protocols! What kind of care they would have to take! What kind of\\nsecrecy they’d have to maintain! Oh My God! Do you think they can row their\\nboats like you do across the sea and along the canals of the country? Do you\\nthink they can freely roam in the forest like a deer as you do?”\\n\\n“Who asked them to be caged? I never said that. If they wish they can also roam\\nin the forests.”\\n\\n“If only wishes were horses… Poonkuzhali. It depends on their birth and the\\nway they have been brought up. You want to fly in the sky like a parrot. But\\nthat’s impossible. You were born on the shores of a sea. That has given you so\\nmuch of freedom. If you had been born in a palace you won’t be free. Listen;\\nthere is another paradox. If the caged parrots get used to the princesses and the\\nroyal food they won’t fly away even if their cages are thrown open. They will fly\\nfor a while and then return to their princesses with their usual screeching sound.\\nI have seen this happening in the palaces in Thanjavur and Pazhaiyaarai.”\\n\\n“I’ll never let myself be caged like that. If only I were a parrot and if only I were\\n\\n\\x0ccaged by a Princess then I’ll bite the hand of the princess which comes to feed\\nme.”\\n\\n“So you will neither be a caged parrot nor a princess caged in her own palace.”\\n\\n“No. I’d rather take poison and die.”\\n\\n“That’s good. In that case you should not desire to marry a Prince living in a\\nPalace.”\\n\\nThe clouds were gathering in the east. There were flashes of lightning. The\\nrumbling of the thunder was heard at a distance. When Chendan Amudhan spoke\\nthose words there were flashes of lightning coming from Poonkuzhali’s bright\\neyes.\\n\\n“Who told you that I want to marry a Prince?”\\n\\n“Nobody told me. I just guessed. If you do not have that kind of a desire then it’s\\ngood. Forget whatever I said.”\\n\\nFor a while silence reigned over the moving boat. Chendan Amudhan was\\npushing the oars. Added to that was the sound of the frogs. And the distant\\nrumbling of thunder and the sound of waves coming from a distant sea.\\n\\nChendan Amudhan cleared his throat. He gathered his courage before speaking\\n\\n\\x0cout his mind.\\n\\n“Poonkuzhali, didn’t you say that Vandhiya Thevan told you about the desire in\\nmy heart? It’ll be better if I get an answer from you at least now. There I could\\nsee the lighthouse of Kodikkarai. I may not get another chance to talk to you in\\nprivate. I may have to leave for Thanjavur tomorrow. My mother has been alone\\nthere for quite some time.”\\n\\n“Why should Vandhiya Thevan act as your messenger? What happened to your\\nmouth? Why don’t you tell me directly what’s there in your heart?”\\n\\n“Ok, have your way. Will you marry me?”\\n\\n“Why do you ask this question?”\\n\\n“Because I love you.”\\n\\n“Should love always end in a marriage?”\\n\\n“Not necessary. But that has been the practice in this world from time\\nimmemorial.”\\n\\n“What will you give me if I marry you? Can you give me the royal life I\\ndeserve? Can you give me dresses, jewels, elephants, horses, palanquins and\\nmaids?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Of course, I cannot. But I will give you a peaceful life which is more precious\\nthan all those regal paraphernalia. Listen, Poonkuzhali. My hut is in a beautiful\\ngarden in Thanjavur. I and my mother live there. If you come there your whole\\nlife will change. My mother will look after you like her own daughter. We’ll get\\nup at dawn and pluck the flowers that would have blossomed in the creepers,\\nplants and trees surrounding the house. We’ll make them into beautiful garlands.\\nThen I’ll go to Thanjavur Thanikulathar Temple and Durga Parameswari Temple\\nto give those garlands. By that time you can have a bath in the lotus pond in our\\ngarden and help my mother in her daily chores. In the evenings we can draw\\nwater from the pond to water the garden. In the evening I’ll teach you Tamil\\nsongs that are sweeter than the elixir of the celestial world. And if you sing them\\nwith your sweet voice, you’ll feel the sweetness in your tongue. And I’ll feel the\\nsweetness in my ears. If you like we can visit a few temples in the evening. We\\ncan sing those songs in those temples too. The devotees who visit the temple will\\nalso be happy. Tell me Poonkuzhali, can there be a life sweeter than this?\\nHappier than this? Think it over, Poonkuzhali.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali laughed out aloud.\\n\\n“Amudha, you described the life which you consider happy. But do you know\\nwhat kind of life I want? I want to go to the celestial world and marry the chief\\nof gods, the Devendra himself. I’ll ride with him in his vehicle, the white\\nelephant whose name is Iravatham. We’ll ride through the clouds of the celestial\\nworld. I’ll grab the Vajrayutha, Devendra’s weapon, and use it over the clouds\\ngathered there. When the clouds are hit by that weapon a million flashes of\\nlightning will be seen on earth. I want to see the sky being rent by those flashes\\nof lightning. Now if the lightning and thunder strikes the earth it falls on some\\ndistant sea. I won’t waste the thunders. I’ll see to it that the palaces in which the\\nPrinces and Princesses live are directly hit by the lightning and thunder. I will be\\nlaughing when I see those palaces crumbling to the ground.\\n\\nIf Devendra does not want to marry me I’ll approach the Wind God. Even if he\\n\\n\\x0chas many wives already I won’t mind becoming his wife. And then there will be\\nnothing but disaster. There will be storms, cyclones, hurricanes and whirlwinds\\non earth all the time. Giant trees will be uprooted by the force of wind and will\\nfall over palaces and mansions destroying them completely. I’ll unleash cyclones\\nand storms on the ships on high seas and break them into pieces. The passengers\\nin those ships will be on high seas and will be struggling for their lives. If there\\nare princes and princesses among those passengers I’ll make them drown to the\\ndepths of the sea. I’ll have mercy on other passengers and save them. And if the\\nWind God refuses to marry me I’ll approach the God of Fire. Then this whole\\nworld will be on fire.”\\n\\n“Stop, Poonkuzhali. Stop that nonsense. The bitterness in your mind makes you\\nutter those terrible things. You have not thought over what you have spoken. It’s\\na great blunder that I proposed to you now without knowing your state of mind.\\nPlease forgive me. I will pray to God night and day to remove the bitterness in\\nyour heart and give you peace of mind.\\n\\nPoonkuzhali suddenly stood up. She looked pointedly at a tree on the banks of\\nthe canal. Chendan Amudhan also looked in the same direction. A woman’s face\\nwas seen between the branches. Chendan Amudhan was stunned for a moment\\nbecause he could see a strong resemblance to his mother’s face. Then he found\\nout it was not his mother. He guessed that it must be his aunt - his mother’s\\nsister. He remembered Poonkuzhali saying that the lady lived in the Ghost Island\\nnear Lanka.\\n\\nPoonkuzhali jumped from the boat and ran towards the woman.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 18 - The Arrow\\n\\nPoonkuzhali saw the Mute Queen hiding behind a tree on the banks of the canal.\\nPoonkuzhali was a little shocked because she never expected to see the lady near\\nKodikkarai. She knew very well that the Mute Queen detested meeting strangers.\\n‘Oh My God, Chendan Amudhan is with me! Will my aunt run away on seeing\\nhim?’\\n\\nPoonkuzhali saw her aunt running. She jumped off from the boat. She climbed\\nup the banks and looked around. She saw her aunt disappearing in the dense\\nforest.\\n\\nChendan Amudhan jumped off the boat and ran up to Poonkuzhali.\\n\\n“Poonkuzhali! Who was that?”\\n\\n“Can’t you recognise her, Amudha?”\\n\\n“I am not very sure. Perhaps... “\\n\\n“Yes, she is my aunt. My father’s sister. Your mother’s elder sister. The one you\\nthought had died long ago.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Yes, she resembles my mother.”\\n\\n“Don’t talk rubbish. There is absolutely no similarity between the two women.\\nEven their qualities are not similar. One is a dumb cow bound to a pole in a\\nhouse while the other is a queen amongst lions which roams freely in the\\nforests.”\\n\\n“That’s ok. But tell me why did the Lion-Queen run away on seeing you?”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali laughed\\n\\n“She ran away on seeing you. She hates strangers.”\\n\\n“But I am not a stranger.”\\n\\n“Aunt does not know that yet. If she did she would not have run away. But she’ll\\nbe reluctant to make your acquaintance.”\\n\\n“What are you going to do now Poonkuzhali?”\\n\\n“I am going to look out for her.”\\n\\n“Can I come along?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Why?”\\n\\n“Just to see my mother’s sister and get to know her.”\\n\\n“Why should you know her?”\\n\\nChendan Amudhan knew something about the Mute Queen’s life. He was\\ncurious to meet her. Who knows, perhaps she might help to change\\nPoonkuzhali’s mind.’\\n\\n“There are a hundred reasons. But tell me should there be a reason to get to\\nknow one’s own mother’s sister?”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali thought for a while.\\n\\n“Ok, come with me. If we go together it’ll be an ordeal to locate her. But I won’t\\nrest till I meet her. Let’s tie the boat here and go.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali secured the boat beneath a dense screw pine bush. Then the two\\nwent towards the dense forest of Kodikkarai.\\n\\n“Poonkuzhali I remember your saying that she is somewhere in the Ghost\\nIsland.”\\n\\n\\x0c“She’ll alternate between Lanka and the Ghost Island.”\\n\\n“Does she come here often?”\\n\\n“No. She comes very rarely. If I don’t see her for a long time she’d come here to\\nsee me.”\\n\\n“Has she come to see you now?”\\n\\n“Looks like she has come on some other work.”\\n\\n“What work?”\\n\\n“Perhaps she has come to know the fate of her foster son, Ponniyin Selvan. She\\nmight probably be anxious to know whether he is alive or he has drowned in the\\nsea. She should have known about the storm that hit the sea after the Prince’s\\nship left the shores.”\\n\\n“Prince Arulmozhivarman is her foster son? Then who is her own son?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. But I am not going to stop till I find out.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Is her own son alive or dead?”\\n\\n“Who knows? He might probably be dead.”\\n\\nThey remained silent for some time. Then Poonkuzhali asked him -\\n\\n“Amudha, you saw your aunt. You said that she resembles your mother. Tell me\\nwhether her face reminds you of somebody else.”\\n\\n“There’s a vague resemblance. I am not very sure. Looks like the whole thing is\\nshrouded in mystery.”\\n\\n“Do you see the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur quite often?”\\n\\n“Once in a while, Yes. Now I remember. She has a striking resemblance to\\nNandini Devi. It’s surprising. How is that possible, Poonkuzhali? And how did\\nyou find it out?”\\n\\n“I have been seeing my aunt for years. And I saw the Pazhuvur Queen here in\\nKodikkarai only a few days ago. The moment I saw her I recognised the strong\\nresemblance between the faces of the two women.”\\n\\n“What could possibly be the reason?”\\n\\n\\x0c“I am going to find out. I am going to ask her today.”\\n\\n“But your Aunt can’t speak. How will she answer your question?”\\n\\n“How do you speak to your mother, Amudha?”\\n\\n“By sign language. I have been doing it since I was born. Even then to broach a\\nnew subject will be extremely difficult.”\\n\\n“I too talk to my aunt in sign language. What cannot be communicated by signs\\nwe communicate by drawing pictures.”\\n\\n“It’s a pity that the two sisters of a family are dumb. I think of their parents. Poor\\nsouls! They must have felt miserable.”\\n\\n“Not only that, Amudha. When they were young the sisters used to fight a lot.\\nThat was the reason grandfather took the elder sister to the Ghost Island and\\nsettled her there. She was our grandfather’s pet child. When she was born an\\nastrologer predicted that she would become a queen one day. Grandfather was\\nexcited. But later when he learnt that she was dumb he was devastated.”\\n\\nThey had entered the forest. They could not locate the Mute Queen.\\n\\n“Amudha, we could not find her because of you. She thinks you as a stranger\\nand is trying to hide herself.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Ok, I am not lucky. Whatever I plan never happens. Can I go now?”\\n\\n“How will you go, Amudha? I’ll have to guide you out of the forest.”\\n\\nThey heard a strange voice from the forest. That was neither a human voice nor\\nthat of an animal. The voice was heard two, three times. A few deer ran towards\\nthe direction of the voice.\\n\\nPoonkuzhali thought for a while.\\n\\n“Amudha follow me without making any noise.”\\n\\nThey started walking towards the direction of the voice. They saw a strange\\nscene there.\\n\\nThe mute queen was leaning against the trunk of a tree. She had a few tender\\nleaves on her hand. She was surrounded by seven or eight deer. There was a\\ncompetition among the animals to eat the leaves in her hand. A deer calf was\\nsitting on her shoulder eagerly looking at her face.\\n\\nPoonkuzhali and Amudhan froze in their places. The deer-calf on the lady’s\\nshoulder was the first one to see them. It jumped down from the lady’s shoulder.\\nMeanwhile the other deer saw them. The deer were ready to flee if the two\\ndecided to come any closer. The Mute Queen also saw the pair. Another strange\\nvoice came from her mouth. The deer ran away from the place.\\n\\n\\x0c“My aunt does not know the language spoken by the people. But she knows the\\nlanguage used by these animals.” There was pride in Poonkuzhali’s voice.\\n\\nThe lady did not run away now. She returned Poonkuzhali’s signal. When\\nPoonkuzhali went near her she hugged her and kissed on her forehead. Chendan\\nAmudhan was still standing at a distance.\\n\\nThe aunt and her niece spoke for a while in sign language. Then Poonkuzhali\\nasked Amudhan to come near.\\n\\nThe mute queen looked at Amudhan. She then placed her hand on his head as if\\nto bless him. Then she withdrew her hand. She then grabbed Poonkuzhali’s hand\\nand dragged her away from that place. Amudhan followed them.\\n\\nThe three reached the banks of the canal. The Mute Queen sat on the bank and\\nwaved her hands to Poonkuzhali.\\n\\n“Come, Amudha, let’s go. She says she won’t come. She wants her food to be\\nbrought here.”\\n\\nThey both started walking towards the light house.\\n\\n“What’s your answer to my question, Poonkuzhali?”\\n\\n\\x0c“I had an idea of coming to Thanjavur with you. But that’s not possible now. My\\naunt wants to see her dear foster son. So I have to take her to Nagapattinam. If\\nyou come she might run away. I can’t get to know those things which I badly\\nwanted to know.”\\n\\nChendhan Amudhan let out a long sigh.\\n\\n“Lady Luck has been avoiding me. Let me take leave of you now.”\\n\\n“No, no. Come with me. To my house. Have your food, talk to your uncle and\\ntake leave of him. Otherwise they’ll shout at me.”\\n\\nOn the way they saw a man and a woman hiding behind a bush discussing\\nsomething very serious.\\n\\n“Oh My God, that’s my sister-in-law, Rakkammal. Looks like her secret parleys\\nare not yet over. Who is she talking to now? Are they the same spies from the\\nPandya Kingdom? Or somebody else?”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali was talking to herself.\\n\\nRakkammal emerged from behind the bush. She was a trifle shocked on seeing\\nPoonkuzhali. But she hid her feelings and almost ran up to them.\\n\\n“Poonkuzhali, where were you all these days? Your father and your brother were\\n\\n\\x0cvery much worried.”\\n\\n“Why should they? This is not the first time I am going out of the house.”\\n\\n“But this time you took your cousin along. They were worried whether you two\\nhad a secret marriage.”\\n\\n“Anni, I have warned you several times not to utter such foolish things in my\\npresence. If you do it again... well you had it.”\\n\\n“No, not at all, my dear. You can marry your cousin or the Prince. Who the hell\\ncares? Your aunt came from Lanka looking for you? Did you see her?”\\n\\n“No. I did not.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali had a minute’s time to talk privately to Amudhan before they\\nreached her house.\\n\\n“Careful, Amudha. Anni is a part of the spy ring of Pandya Kingdom. She’ll try\\nto pull out the words from your mouth. Be very careful. Don’t answer any of her\\nquestions. Tell her you don’t know anything.”\\n\\n“Let me also be dumb so long as I am here in your house.”\\n\\n\\x0cThe same afternoon Poonkuzhali was rowing her boat towards Nagapattinam.\\nThe Mute Queen was the only other passenger in the boat. Poonkuzhali always\\nused to be peaceful and at times even blissful while in the company of the Mute\\nQueen. But this time Poonkuzhali was not.\\n\\nShe remembered taking a sick Ponniyin Selvan in her boat only a few days ago.\\nThe memory of that trip came quite often. Now she felt that she took all the\\ntrouble only to unite the Prince with another Princess. She felt a sharp pain in her\\nheart.\\n\\nShe also felt bad for Chendan Amudhan. She had almost driven him away to his\\nplace. Her heart melted when she realised that she had been quite heartless with\\nher cousin.\\n\\nMore disturbing than these thoughts were the words of her father, Thiyaga\\nVidangaraiyar. Those were not words but warnings.\\n\\n“My dear child, it’ll be prudent if you can control your movements especially\\nduring these troubled times. I see new faces coming here quite often. I don’t\\nknow why they come here. I infer some conspiracy is being hatched in our\\nKingdom. I don’t want you to be caught in the net of conspirators. Our family is\\nforever indebted to the family of the Chozha Kings. Never ever forget this, my\\nchild.”\\n\\nWhen Poonkuzhali connected her father’s words and the clandestine activities of\\nher sister-in-law her body trembled in fear. ‘Perhaps those strangers came\\nlooking out for me. Perhaps they want to know where Ponniyin Selvan is by\\nfollowing me. Oh My God, that would amount to compromising on his security.\\nIt’d be a great crime.’\\n\\n\\x0cThe rustling sound heard near the banks increased her fears. There was no wind\\nat that time. It appeared as if all the elements of Nature were conspiring to block\\nthe wind. In the absence of wind what would have caused that rustling sound?\\nThe mute queen was not disturbed as she could not hear any sound. There was\\nno point in discussing that sound with her.\\n\\nBut the other senses of the mute queen were abnormally sharper. She could use\\nher eyes and brain to know what other people knew by their ears. And so long as\\nshe was there no danger can ensue to Poonkuzhali.\\n\\nBut what’s happening? Even my aunt looks disturbed. She is anxiously looking at\\nthe banks of the canal. Is somebody following us?\\n\\nThe reason for the mute queen looking at the banks with concern soon became\\nclear to Poonkuzhali. And she felt relieved.\\n\\nThere were about five or six deer in a place hidden in the bushes on the bank.\\nThey were peeping to look at the boat. No, not at the boat but at the Mute Queen.\\nNo other animal was as beautiful as deer. Why did God create men after creating\\nsuch beautiful creatures like deer? Men are devils. There were men who were\\nfond of hunting such beautiful animals! It was a shame on humanity.\\n\\nPoonkuzhali was absorbed in the beauty of the deer. Her hands stopped rowing.\\n\\nA strange sound came from the mute queen. That was not like the sound\\nPoonkuzhali heard from her in the morning. There was immense fear and a sense\\n\\n\\x0cof caution in the sound now. The deer heard the sound and started running away\\nfrom the scene. At the same time an arrow came from nowhere and landed on\\none of the deer. The injured deer let out a pathetic wail. The mute queen jumped\\nfrom the boat and ran towards the deer.\\n\\nAs she came near the deer there was a rustling of leaves all around her. In the\\nnext few seconds she was surrounded by seven or eight men. They were armed\\nwith spears.\\n\\nRakkammal, Poonkuzhali’s sister-in-law who had guided them to the place was\\nseen at a distance.\\n\\nThe mute queen tried to run away. She could not. When she learnt that all her\\nescape routes were cut off she stood still.\\n\\nTwo men came near her and bound her with ropes.\\n\\nAll these happened in a few seconds in the sight of Poonkuzhali.\\n\\nWhen Poonkuzhali saw the Mute Queen being bound by those men she sprang\\nfrom the boat and came running to the place screaming. She was using the oar as\\na weapon.\\n\\nFive or six men ran towards Poonkuzhali. They caught hold of her and dragged\\nher to her boat. She was thrown into the boat and was bound by ropes. The men\\nthen went away. The Mute Queen followed them submissively. They all\\n\\n\\x0cvanished from the place in a few seconds.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 19 - The Laughter And The Fire\\n\\nPoonkuzhali was struggling hard to release herself from the ropes that bound her\\nto her boat. That was not an easy task. The crooks had tied the rope several times\\nover and had made several knots. Poonkuzhali’s knife was lying on the boat\\nfloor. If only one of her hands were free she could have used it to take the knife\\nand cut off the ropes. But those evil men had secured her wrists tightly to her\\nback and then to the boat. Poonkuzhali strained herself to bend and grab the\\nknife with her mouth. While holding the knife in her mouth she cut the rope at\\none point. The grip over one of her hands loosened. With great effort she freed\\none hand. Then it was pretty easy to free her completely.\\n\\nIt took more than thirty minutes for her to free herself from the ropes. She heard\\nthe sound of footsteps. Then she saw a moving shadow. She thought that one of\\nthe captors had been left behind to make sure that she did not escape. The\\nmoment the person appeared before her she decided to throw the sharp knife at\\nhim and kill him. But what a disappointment!\\n\\n“Poonkuzhali! Poonkuzhali”\\n\\nIt was Chendan Amudhan’s voice. The next moment his terror-stricken face\\nappeared on the banks.\\n\\nPoonkuzhali secured the knife in her waist. Amudhan too had seen her.\\n\\n“Poonkuzhali, are you alive?” - He came running towards her.\\n\\n\\x0c“Why, you don’t want to see me alive? Do me a favour, please. Kill me with\\nyour own hands. But I know you are too timid to do that.”\\n\\n“Oh My God! Why are you so harsh, Poonkuzhali? Why should I kill you? You\\nare now killing me with your words.”\\n\\n“Why didn’t you come a little earlier? You’ll never know how much I suffered to\\nfree myself from these bloody ropes.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali tried to stand. But as her legs were tangled in a maze of ropes she\\nwas about to trip. Amudhan rushed to her side and held her in his arms.\\n\\n“Oh My God, see what those crooks have done to you! I can see the rope marks\\nall over your body.”\\n\\n“If you are really concerned about me why didn’t you come a little earlier?”\\n\\n“You have been asking the same question again and again. How could I know\\nthat you were in danger? You almost drove me away with your words. I was on\\nthe way to my town.”\\n\\n“Then why did you come back? Perhaps to see if I am dead and perform the\\nfuneral?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Legend says that my Lord Shiva had poison in his throat. And you have it on\\nyour tongue. Your sister-in-law told me that you might possibly be in danger. So\\nI came running. And I have been amply rewarded for what I have done.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali had come to the bank by now.\\n\\n“I was about to throw this knife on you. You escaped. The first thing I am going\\nto do is to kill my sister-in-law with this knife. Where is that devil?”\\n\\n“Why are you pouncing on that woman? Why are you so furious with her? Is it\\nan offence to ask me to help you out of danger?”\\n\\n“No. She’s the one who betrayed my aunt. You also saw her talking to somebody\\nhiding behind the bushes.”\\n\\n“You are wrong, Poonkuzhali. I don’t know who she was talking to. But one\\nthing is for sure. She did not betray your aunt. Those crooks who forcibly\\nabducted your aunt had tied your sister-in-law to a tree. They also hit her on her\\nhead. She is badly hurt.”\\n\\n“That’s strange! I can’t believe that! Looks like she has deceived you. But tell\\nme why did you come back? Where did you see my sister-in-law? I want to\\nknow everything.”\\n\\nChendan Amudhan started a long narration.\\n\\n\\x0cChendan Amudhan was reluctantly walking on the road to Thanjavur. He did not\\nhave the heart to go away from Poonkuzhali.\\n\\nHe heard somebody screaming from the forest near the road. He could also hear\\nthe sound of footsteps. Chendan Amudhan hid behind a tree on the road side.\\nAbout seven or eight soldiers, all wielding spears, walked into the highway from\\nthe forest. Amudhan remembered to have seen a woman in their midst. The lady\\nappeared like Poonkuzhali’s aunt. Amudhan first thought that it was only a\\nhallucination.\\n\\nAfter the soldiers had gone away he heard a woman screaming for help. The\\nscream came from the forest. His first instinct was not to get involved in what\\nwas possibly a crime scene. He wanted to ignore the call for help and go on his\\nway. But then he decided to help the lady in distress and went in the direction of\\nthe sound.\\n\\nHe saw Rakkammal bound to a tree. Blood was oozing from her head making\\nher face a bloody mess. Amudhan was frightened. He did not have the heart to\\ngo near her. After some time he hardened himself and approached the woman.\\nHe freed her. As he was taking off the ropes he bombarded her with questions:\\n\\n‘Who did this? And why? Who were the men who just walked up to the highway\\nfrom here? There was a woman in their midst. Who is she?\\n\\n“Yes, Amudha. They are kidnapping your aunt. I tried my best to prevent it.\\nThat’s why they beat me up and tied me to this tree. Your cousin, Poonkuzhali\\nand your aunt were going in the boat. These men dragged your aunt from the\\nboat. I don’t know what happened to Poonkuzhali. Please run. Otherwise it may\\nbe too late...”\\n\\n\\x0cChendhan Amudhan was shocked. He started to run.\\n\\n“Just a minute, Thambi. Do you by any chance know where Poonkuzhali and\\nthat dumb devil were going? And why did they not take you with them? Where\\nare you going alone, now?”\\n\\nAmudhan did not like the way she talked. Especially the way she referred to his\\naunt as ‘dumb devil.’ “Will tell you later.” Amudhan muttered and ran towards\\nthe canal. His heart was in his mouth. What would have happened to\\nPoonkuzhali? Would they have beaten her up? Or killed her?\\n\\nHe heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Poonkuzhali alive and unharmed.\\n\\n“Now tell me Poonkuzhali, weren’t you wrong in accusing your sister-in-law?”\\n\\n“Seems so. Where did you leave her? Let’s go there now.”\\n\\n“Will she be there now?”\\n\\n“She must be in the vicinity. Or she might come looking for us. Didn’t she ask\\nwhere my aunt and I were headed to?”\\n\\n“Yes, she did.”\\n\\n\\x0c“I hope you did not answer her question. Are you sure?”\\n\\n“I am. Since she referred to my Periamma as ‘dumb devil’ I was disgusted with\\nher and did not have the mind to respond to her question.”\\n\\n“Take it from me, even if she were to ask in all nice words, don’t tell her\\nanything. Do you know why she is keen to know our destination? I don’t know;\\nbut I am sure she must have her reasons. I am not sure about her innocence. The\\ncrooks might have got the information through my sister-in-law and once their\\npurpose was served they might have beaten her up and abandoned her. Even if\\nthat were not true she must have followed us with some evil intentions. So be\\ncareful with her. Don’t let her deceive you.”\\n\\n“Poonkuzhali, I remember your saying that your brother acts dumb in the\\npresence of his wife. Well, I’ll do the same. You do all the talking.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali laughed.\\n\\n“The sound of your laugh is like sweet honey to my ears. It appears as if I am\\nhearing the sweet songs on my Lord composed by the great saint\\nThirunavukkarasar.”\\n\\n“Well, my laughing was just an inadvertent act. Don’t’ be carried away by that.\\nMy mind is still boiling. A fire is raging in my heart.”\\n\\n\\x0c“There is no better way to quell that fire than my Lord’s love.”\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 20 - The Doctor’s Son Once Again\\n\\nPoonkuzhali and Chendan Amudhan were walking through the forest. They were\\nenveloped in a screen of uncomfortable silence.\\n\\nPoonkuzhali let out a long sigh and spoke in a soft voice.\\n\\n“Amudha, perhaps there’s something between us. We must have known each\\nother in our previous births as well.”\\n\\n“I am least concerned about our previous births. I’ll be grateful if you can give a\\nfavourable answer for something regarding this birth.”\\n\\n“They say that the relationship two people shared in an earlier birth will continue\\nin the next one as well. That must be true, Amudha. When we parted ways this\\nafternoon I thought I will never see you again. But it was so ordained that we\\nhad to meet again within fifty minutes.”\\n\\n“You need not grieve on that account. Once we cross this forest and reach the\\nThanjavur Highway I’ll go my way. You are free to do whatever you like.”\\n\\n“I am not going to leave you like that, Amudha. After talking to my sister-in-law\\nI’ll come with you to Thanjavur. I am going to seek justice for my aunt. I am\\ngoing to complain at the Emperor’s Court.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Poonkuzhali, do you still think it’s easy to approach the Emperor? Lay people\\nlike us cannot even enter the Fort, let alone the King’s Court.”\\n\\n“Why not? If they refuse to open the Fort gates I’ll break them open. And if that\\nis not possible I’ll scale the wall and jump in.”\\n\\n“What will you do with the security guards on duty at the entrance of the Fort?”\\n\\n“They will be simply frightened by my screams. They’ll take me to the\\nEmperor.”\\n\\n“I don’t think so, Poonkuzhali. You can’t easily frighten the person in charge of\\nthe Fort’s security - I mean the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar. People say that without\\nthe Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s permission even the Lord of Death cannot enter the\\nFort. Some even say that the Emperor is still alive because of that.”\\n\\n“What if I can’t see the Emperor? I’ll see the Pazhuvettaraiyars and seek justice\\nfor my aunt. And if I don’t get justice there I’ll run to the Chief Minister\\nAniruddha Brahmarayar. And if I fail to get justice there I’ll run to Pazhaiyaarai\\nand complain to the Queens. I won’t rest till I know what happened to my aunt. I\\nwon’t sleep till she gets justice. Didn’t my sister-in-law say that my aunt is a\\n‘dumb devil’? Well, I’ll become a devil and roam in the cities and villages of this\\nKingdom. I will be crying ‘Justice’ ‘Justice’ as I wander in the country. Amudha,\\nwill you be me with in this?”\\n\\n“Sure, Poonkuzhali, but only if you want me to come. But honestly why should\\n\\n\\x0cyou let your mind swayed by emotions? You have gone way too far. Your first\\npriority is to find where your aunt is and save her from danger. To free her from\\nher evil captors. Shouldn’t you tell your father and brother about this?”\\n\\n“Amudha, my aunt has divine powers. Nobody can harm her. Like the legendary\\nDhamayanthi who burnt the hunter with her powers she could burn her enemies\\nby her mere glance. I am not worried about her. But I can’t bear to see such a\\ngross atrocity happening in broad daylight in Chozha Kingdom. People say\\nParanthaka’s reign is one of righteousness. Ours is a country which was once\\nruled by the great devotee of Lord Shiva, Kandaraathithar. The tiger and the cow\\nused to drink from the same pond. We have been living in that kind of peace and\\nglory. Our Government is boasting that in Sundara Chozhan’s rule even a young\\nwoman can walk alone at night without any fear for her safety. Ours is such a\\nglorious country. And in that country if criminals can abduct an old woman who\\ncan neither speak nor hear in broad day light, well to me, that’s the greatest of\\ncrimes ever committed in this country. I am not that concerned about my aunt.\\nBut whatever happened to her today can happen to me tomorrow. And can\\nhappen to any young woman living in this country.\\n\\nChendan Amudhan spoke:\\n\\n“Yes, we are surrounded by dangers at present. Ever since Sundara Chozhan\\nbecame bedridden evil has gained an upper hand. Justice and righteousness have\\nvanished. The ordinary men and women are not safe. And for the young girls of\\nthis country danger is waiting for them at every street corner. My suggestion to\\nthe young women of this country is “get married to the right man soon.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali laughed.\\n\\n“Amudha, if a young woman marries you, can you protect her? Do you know\\n\\n\\x0chow to handle a sword? Do you know how to fight?”\\n\\n“I only know how to make a garland of flowers. I only know how to sing the\\npraises of my Lord. I have not learnt the art of fighting with a sword. So what?\\nDidn’t you teach me how to row a boat? In the same way I’ll learn to fight.\\nWhen Madhuranthakan can have the ambition of ruling this country, my learning\\nto handle a sword is not so difficult a task.”\\n\\nBy that time, they had reached the place where Poonkuzhali’s sister-in-law was\\nbound to a tree. They could not find her there. Amudhan showed the blood spots\\nto Poonkuzhali suggesting that the blood might have come from the woman’s\\nhead.\\n\\n“It seems they have roughed her up. I am now sure that my sister-in-law was not\\nworking for the gang who abducted by aunt. But we should somehow know who\\nshe is working for.”\\n\\n“Please listen to me, Poonkuzhali. Whatever has happened appears quite\\nmysterious. Looks like there are secrets within secrets. All these complications\\ninvolve the King and his family. Why should we bother about all these things?\\nWhy should we invite danger?”\\n\\n“Amudha, let it be a sensitive political issue. Let it be a deep mystery. But tell\\nme how can I stand off from something involving my aunt? And she’s your\\nmother’s sister as well. How can you distance yourself from her?”\\n\\n“I’m speaking what’s there in my mind, Poonkuzhali. Didn’t I tell you about the\\nseven or eight men walking on the road and a woman walking with them in the\\n\\n\\x0ccentre? Well, judging by the way she walked I don’t think that she has been\\nabducted. It appears as if she was willingly going with them. I don’t think that\\nshe is forcibly taken.”\\n\\n“Possible, Amudha. That is also possible. But that’s my aunt’s nature. She might\\nwant to know where she is being taken. And if she doesn’t like she can escape\\neven from a thousand men. She can’t be imprisoned even in the mightiest of\\nForts and the worst underground dungeons. That was why I said that I am not\\nconcerned about her safety. My mission is to correct the injustice meted out to\\nher. No, I am not talking about what happened today, but what happened twenty\\nfive years ago. That was the greatest injustice committed against a woman. I\\nwon’t rest till I seek retribution for that.”\\n\\n“Oh My God! You’ve let your mind drift towards an impossible task.” Amudhan sighed.\\n\\nThey heard somebody talking. One of the voices belonged to a woman.\\nAmudhan and Poonkuzhali saw those who were talking at the Thanjavur High\\nRoad.\\n\\nOne was Poonkuzhali’s sister-in-law Rakkammal. The person whom she was\\ntalking to was the son of the Chief Doctor of Pazhaiyaarai. Poonkuzhali was\\ndisgusted on seeing that worm.\\n\\nRakkammal saw Poonkuzhali.\\n\\n“Oh, you are safe! I thought that they might have killed you. See, what those\\ncrooks have done to me! All because I tried to save your aunt! I was asking for\\n\\n\\x0csome medicine from the Doctor’s son.”\\n\\n“Even if the Karaiyar’s daughter is hurt I am ready to treat her.” - The Doctor’s\\nson blurted out.\\n\\nPoonkuzhali did not respond to his offer. Instead she asked her sister-in-law:\\n\\n“Anni, do you where the abductors are taking my aunt? Tell me which direction\\nthey took.”\\n\\n“I didn’t see. But this Doctor’s son says that they went in the direction of\\nThanjavur High Road.”\\n\\n“Anni, Amudhan and I are going to look for her. Please tell my father. Come,\\nAmudha, let’s go.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali started to move.\\n\\nThe Doctor’s son spoke to her.\\n\\n“Stop, Poonkuzhali. You two can’t go after them. They have horses which were\\nwaiting for them at a short distance from here. They would have ridden from\\nthere. I have a horse with me. I can chase them at the speed of wind and then\\ncome back to tell you about their whereabouts. And in return I want a small help\\nfrom you. Just tell me where your aunt and you were headed for when the crooks\\n\\n\\x0ccaptured her.\\n\\nPoonkuzhali spoke to her sister-in-law.\\n\\n“Anni, we do not need his help. We’ll find them on our own. Just tell my father.”\\n\\nThe Doctor’s son was quite adamant.\\n\\n“Aha, see the pride of Karaiyar’s daughter! She does not need my help. Girl,\\nwhy are you so furious with me? Did I prevent you from marrying the Prince?\\nYou deceived me and took that man from Vaana Clan Vandhiya Thevan on your\\nboat. And he killed the Prince by pushing him into the sea. What’s the point in\\nbeing angry with me?”\\n\\nThe Doctor’s son laughed.\\n\\nThere was fire in Poonkuzhali’s eyes when she stared at him. She then grabbed\\nAmudhan’s hand and started walking up ahead. When she was out of their\\nhearing range she told Amudhan, “When you first learn to fight with a sword\\nyou should kill this crook, the Doctor’s son. He should be the first victim of your\\nsword, Amudha.”\\n\\nThey walked day and night on the road to Thanjavur. They asked the people on\\nthe way if any of them had seen seven or eight men going on horses along with a\\nwoman. They did have some information to start with. But after some time they\\nwere stonewalled. Everybody had witnessed that strange sight; but nobody could\\n\\n\\x0csay who were they and where were they headed. They decided to go to\\nThanjavur anyway.\\n\\nChendan Amudhan found the travel quite interesting. Poonkuzhali was the main\\nreason. Another reason was that he trained himself on using the sword. He\\nbought a sword near Kodikkarai from a blacksmith known to Poonkuzhali.\\nWhile walking on the road he was constantly swirling the sword as if he were\\nfighting with an enemy. His lack of training showed in the haphazard way he\\nturned around the sword. At those times Poonkuzhali taught him how to hold a\\nsword and how to wield it against an enemy. The training session made the\\ntravelling experience memorable to both.\\n\\nOnly when they saw the Thanjavur Fort at a distance Poonkuzhali became\\nserious. Chendan Amudhan shared her concern. Even to enter the Fort was a\\nfeat; how were they going to take their prayer for justice to high places?\\nAmudhan remembered the tricks played by Vandhiya Thevan in a similar\\nsituation.\\n\\nShould I not have at least a tenth of his smartness? How good it would have\\nbeen if Vandhiya Thevan is here with me to guide me in this critical mission.\\n\\nIf Vandhiya Thevan is caught in a situation like this, what will he do? How will\\nhe act?\\n\\nThey saw a closed palanquin going to the Fort. The sun had just set and a\\nblanket of darkness was being slowly spread over them. There were pictures of\\npalm tree on the screen that covered the palanquin.\\n\\n\\x0c‘Oh My God! This seems to be the palanquin of the Junior Queen. If only we\\ncould get her signet ring, all our problems will be solved.’\\n\\nAmudhan shared his thoughts with Poonkuzhali. ‘Not a bad idea’ Poonkuzhali\\ntold him.\\n\\nBut how was he going to draw the attention of the Junior Queen who was inside\\nthe closed palanquin? There were armed guards in front of the vehicle as well as\\nin the back. The guards might not even let him go near the palanquin.\\n\\n“Don’t worry, Amudha the Fort is still a mile away. We’ll have enough\\nopportunities.”\\n\\nAnd they got a wonderful opportunity in the most unexpected manner.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 21 - The Palanquin Ride\\n\\nThe arrival of the monsoon was delayed that year. The rains appeared to start\\nbut they never did. There were a couple of false starts and the dry weather\\ncontinued. The water flow in Cauvery and its tributaries had considerably gone\\ndown.\\n\\nThe farmers had planted hoping for a good monsoon. The saplings were about to\\nwither for want of rains. “It’s all because of that evil comet” - people shifted the\\nblame to the inanimate comet.\\n\\n“The Kingdom is in a mess.”\\n\\n“The political affairs are in a state of confusion.”\\n\\n“No news about the Prince.”\\n\\n“And now the rains have failed us.”\\n\\nChendan Amudhan and Poonkuzhali were hearing this refrain throughout their\\njourney.\\n\\nOf course the absence of rains made their travel faster and more comfortable.\\n\\n\\x0cThe days were clear. The afternoons were sultry. Even while walking under the\\nshady trees of the highway they sweated.\\n\\n“Doesn’t look like the rainy month of Aippasi. It appears as if we are in the\\nmiddle of summer - in the month of Vaikasi.”\\n\\nSoon after the Pazhuvettaraiyar’s palanquin passed by their side they\\nexperienced a cool breeze. The leaves on the trees rustled in the wind creating a\\npleasant noise. They could see dark clouds in the north eastern horizon. In a\\nshort time the clouds were rushing towards them as if they were a herd of\\nelephants on the run.\\n\\nThe breeze became a strong wind and then a gale. The wind carried small\\ndroplets of water which fell on them. It started with a drizzle. And then it\\nbecame a torrential downpour. It was difficult to describe the plight of the\\nroadside trees in the wind and rain. The branches broke down. The birds which\\nhad nested in the branches flew in all the directions. The people walking on the\\nroad ran for cover.\\n\\nSome were afraid of the wind and the rain and so they started to run. Others\\nwere afraid of the tree branches falling over their heads. They too ran. Some\\nfeared that that it was the onset of the apocalypse and hence ran away in mortal\\nfear. The day faded into night. Chendan Amudhan and Poonkuzhali abandoned\\nthe thought of entering the Thanjavur Fort before nightfall.\\n\\nThey decided to go to Chendan Amudhan’s garden outside the city limits. They\\nwalked on the streets carefully providing support to one another.\\n\\n\\x0c“Poonkuzhali, you must have seen many a storm and rain in the high seas. You\\nhave rowed your boat in the middle of huge mountains. I am surprised to see you\\nafraid of this rain.”\\n\\n“However strong may be the storm or the rain, when you are in the middle of the\\nsea no tree will fall on your head. At the most you might be struck by a\\nlightning.”\\n\\nEven as Poonkuzhali was talking they could hear a tree crashing at a distance.\\nAmudhan gripped Poonkuzhali’s hands and stopped at that place.\\n\\n“There is no point in going further in this weather. There are some mandapams\\non the road side. Let’s stay in one of them till the weather gets better.”\\n\\n“Agreed! But how do we find a mandapam in this darkness?”\\n\\n“We have the lightning to guide us. We will have to see on both the sides very\\ncarefully.”\\n\\nVery soon there was a lightning. It bathed the sky and the earth in glorious light.\\n\\n“I can see a mandapam there!”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali too saw the structure. She also saw a huge tree that had just fallen\\ndown. It appeared as if some people were caught under the tree.\\n\\n\\x0c“Amudha, did you see the fallen tree? Can you see beneath the tree.. “\\n\\n“Yes, I did. Fast. Let’s run to the mandapam, otherwise we’ll also be trapped.”\\n\\nHe held her hand and ran towards the building.\\n\\nThey reached the mandapam soon. They squeezed the water from their dresses.\\nPoonkuzhali tried to dry her long hair. The water from their dresses ran through\\nthe building.\\n\\n“God, we have made the place wet.”\\n\\n“That’s okay, Poonkuzhali. The mandapam won’t be hurt. I don’t think it’d have\\ncold or fever because of this running water. You are fully drenched.”\\n\\n“I was born and brought up in the sea. I have another name, Samudra Kumari.\\nThe rain water cannot harm me.”\\n\\nHer mind leapt from that road-side mandapam to the Choodamani Monastery of\\nNagapattinam. The person who first called her ‘Samudra Kumari’ was in the\\nmonastery.\\n\\n“Poonkuzhali my garden and hut is quite near. As soon as the rain abates we’ll\\n\\n\\x0cgo there. My mother will take good care of you.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali did not hear Amudhan’s words fully.\\n\\nThere was a flash of lightning. They were shocked by what they saw. A big\\nbanyan tree had fallen down at a place almost opposite to the mandapam. Its\\nbranches and aerial roots were everywhere. Two horses and about five or six\\npeople were trapped under the fallen tree. A few others were trying to rescue\\nthose people. They were trying to remove the branches. “Here” “There” “Fast”\\n“Aiyoo”, “Oh My God” - the sound of rain was punctuated by the sounds heard\\nfrom the place.\\n\\nBut something else caught the attention of Chendan Amudhan and Poonkuzhali.\\nThere was a palanquin on the ground near the fallen tree. Two men were\\nstanding guard for the palanquin. The rest were perhaps involved in the rescue\\noperations.\\n\\n“Amudha, did you see the palanquin?”\\n\\n“Yes, I did. Looks like the palanquin of the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur.”\\n\\n“It would have been better if the tree had fallen on the palanquin.”\\n\\n“Oh My God! Why are you saying that? Didn’t you say that you wanted to meet\\nthe Pazhuvur Queen and get things done through her?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Yes, I did. But I don’t like that woman.”\\n\\n“If you don’t like somebody then a tree should fall on them, right?”\\n\\n“Should trees fall only on ordinary people? Should it not fall on queens and\\nprincesses? That’s ok. Shall we go to the palanquin and speak to the Pazhuvur\\nQueen? Shall we seek her help to enter the fort?”\\n\\n“You have chosen the best time to see her. If we go near the palanquin now we\\nmight be mistaken as robbers and might be beaten up by the guards.”\\n\\n“If only I am able to see her then things will be easy.”\\n\\n“How?”\\n\\n“I’ll drop my sister-in-law’s name. Or tell her that the sorcerer Ravidasan sent\\nme.”\\n\\n“Good idea. But how are we going to go near her?”\\n\\nThere was a flash of lightning. They saw two men lifting the palanquin.\\n\\nOh My God, have they started? No, no. Looks like the palanquin is coming here.\\n\\n\\x0cIn a few seconds the palanquin reached the entrance of the mandapam. The\\nbearers gently placed it on the floor.\\n\\n“Perhaps the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur is looking for us.” - Poonkuzhali.\\n\\nAmudhan gripped her hand and tried to move further inside. Poonkuzhali\\nresisted his move.\\n\\nThere was a commanding voice - “Who’s there?”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali knew that the voice belonged to one of the bearers.\\n\\n“Don’t worry, brother. We too are travellers like you. We too have come here\\nbecause of the rains.”\\n\\n“Ok. But don’t come near the palanquin.”\\n\\n“Why should we do that, brother? One has to have some good fortune to ride in\\na palanquin.” - Poonkuzhali answered him.\\n\\nAmudhan too joined the conversation.\\n\\n\\x0c“While talking about the good deeds in the past the great poet Thiruvalluvar has\\nspoken about riding in a palanquin.”\\n\\n“Enough. Keep your mouths shut. How many of you are there?”\\n\\n“We are only two. But this mandapam can hold even two hundred.”\\n\\nAmudhan told what he believed to be true. He did not know that there was a\\nthird person in the mandapam hiding behind one of the pillars.\\n\\nThe palanquin bearer spoke to his companion.\\n\\n“I told them, you know. That we can take shelter in the mandapam when the\\nrains came. They did not listen. If they did this would not have happened.”\\n\\n“Who knew this will happen? We thought that we can reach the Fort before the\\nrains became stronger. Thank God, the tree did not fall on the palanquin.”\\n\\nThere was another flash of lighting. The eyes of Amudhan and Poonkuzhali did\\nnot move away from the palanquin. They could see a woman in the palanquin.\\nShe moved away the screen to have a look at them. She recognized them and\\nsmiled.\\n\\nThe next moment the place plunged into darkness.\\n\\n\\x0cPoonkuzhali spoke almost in a whisper.\\n\\n“Did you see, Amudha?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Did you see who’s in the palanquin?”\\n\\n“Is it not the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur?”\\n\\n“What do you think?”\\n\\n“Looks like the Pazhuvur Queen. But I am doubtful.”\\n\\n“But I don’t have any doubts. I am very sure.”\\n\\n“Sure of what?”\\n\\n“It’s not the Queen of Pazhuvur. It’s my aunt, the Mute Queen.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Sh.. don’t shout.”\\n\\n“Unless I shout it won’t happen.”\\n\\n“What should happen?”\\n\\n“The one for which we came all the way. We have now found our aunt.\\nShouldn’t we rescue her and take her back?”\\n\\n“That’s impossible, Poonkuzhali. We’ll follow the palanquin and find its\\ndestination. Then we can plan our rescue operations.”\\n\\n“Why are you beating around the bush? I am not for it. I want to get her released\\nright now. If you are afraid you keep quiet.”\\n\\n“But Poonkuzhali your aunt should be willing to be released. It appears as if she\\nis going on her own free will, majestically riding in a palanquin. Where is she\\ngoing? What for? Who ordered her capture? Should we not know the answers to\\nall these questions?”\\n\\n“Maybe she is being taken to the underground dungeons. Once she is imprisoned\\nthere we can’t do anything.”\\n\\n“Why not? I was in those dungeons once and I came out. I do have some\\ninfluence in the Palaces in Thanjavur. I’ll try to get your aunt released. Keep\\n\\n\\x0cquiet now.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali wanted to be patient. She did not want to do anything. But\\nsomething unexpected happened.\\n\\nThe screens of the palanquin moved apart. A figure came out. It walked like a\\ncat without making any noise. The next second it was near them. As all this\\nhappened in total darkness it escaped the eyes of the bearers and guards.\\nPoonkuzhali knew for sure that it was the Mute Queen. The Mute Queen held\\nthe hands of Amudhan and Poonkuzhali and dragged them to the back of the\\nmandapam.\\n\\nShe then hugged Poonkuzhali and kissed on her forehead to express her\\nhappiness. The aunt and niece talked for a while in sign language. How could\\nthey do that in utter darkness? How could they communicate to each other? That\\nwas something beyond explanation.\\n\\nPoonkuzhali then spoke to Amudhan.\\n\\n“Can you understand what she says? She wants me to go in the palanquin. She\\nwants you to take her to your place.”\\n\\n“What do you think, Poonkuzhali?”\\n\\n“That seems to be a good idea. We’ll know the identity of her captors.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Think it over, Poonkuzhali. Yes, it’s a good idea. But is it not very risky?”\\n\\n“Don’t worry, Amudha. I won’t be harmed. I have this knife in my waist. I’ll\\ntake care.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali hugged her aunt and took leave of her. And like her aunt she\\nwalked like a cat silently towards the palanquin. She got into the palanquin and\\npulled in the screens.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 22 - Chief Minister Aniruddhar Disappointed\\n\\nChief Minister Aniruddha Brahmarayar had been camping in the capital for a\\nfew days. His Palace was buzzing with activity. Government officials,\\nChieftains, Generals, Foreign Ambassadors, Representatives of Traders’ Groups,\\nTrustees of Temples, Tamil and Sanskrit scholars swarmed to his Palace to have\\nprivate audience with him.\\n\\nThe Chief Minister did not have any security guards for him. He kept his official\\nretinue to the barest minimum. That minimized the possible friction between the\\nChief Minister and the Pazhuvettaraiyars.\\n\\nEven then the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar was not happy about the Chief Minister\\nextending his stay in the Capital. He thought that the security arrangements were\\na little lax ever since the Minister arrived in the city. All and sundry made their\\nway into the Fort on the pretext of seeing the Chief Minister. The Chief\\nMinister’s palace was adjacent to the King’s main Palace and the crowd in the\\nMinisters palace seeped over to the main palace. Of course Junior\\nPazhuvettaraiyar, though the official commander of the Fort’s security, could not\\nprevent anybody who had the Chief Minister’s signet ring, from entering the\\nMinister’s palace.\\n\\nThe Junior was not at all happy with the state of affairs. He did not have the\\ncourage to confront the Chief Minister and sort out the matters with him. If his\\nbrother, the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar were there in the city, the two brothers\\nwould have discussed the issue and would have found a smart solution. But\\nunfortunately the Senior had gone to Kadambur. Without his elder brother the\\nJunior Pazhuvettaraiyar, also known as Kalaanthaka Kandar, felt that one of his\\nhands had been taken away. And as if to add fuel to the fire the Chief Minister\\nwas frequently sending orders to the Junior in the pretext of seeking his help in\\n\\n\\x0cadministration.\\n\\nA few days ago the Chief Minister wanted some soldiers to be sent to Kodikkarai\\nfor some important work. The Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar obliged. And the previous\\nday the Minister wanted the closed Palanquin of the Pazhuvur Palace along with\\nthe bearers to bring a lady of high rank to his Palace. The Junior\\nPazhuvettaraiyar complied with this request as well.\\n\\nBut he started thinking.\\n\\n‘The Minister is involved in some conspiracy. Who is the high society woman\\nwho has to be brought in the closed palanquin? And why is she brought here? I\\nshould find that out. What a pity! My brother is not here at this time! How am I\\ngoing to handle this situation?’\\n\\nAlong with the Pazhuvettaraiyar another person was also keen on knowing the\\nidentity of the woman who was being brought to Aniruddhar’s Palace - the Chief\\nMinister’s most trusted disciple, Azhwarkkadian.\\n\\nOn the day after the heavy rains the Chief Minister got up early, finished his\\nablutions, had his breakfast and came to the entrance of his Palace. He sent a\\nman to find out who were waiting to see him.\\n\\nWhen he heard that Azhwarkkadian was one among them he ordered to bring\\nhim right away. Azhwarkkadian stood before his mentor with all reverence and\\nhumility.\\n\\n\\x0c“Thirumalai, what happened to your mission?”\\n\\n“Failure, Master.”\\n\\n“I expected that. Were you able to meet the Crown Prince?”\\n\\n“I did meet him, Master. I told him whatever you wanted me to tell him. But\\nthey were of no use, Master. I couldn’t prevent the Crown Prince from visiting\\nthe Kadambur Palace.”\\n\\n“Is the Prince still in Kadambur?”\\n\\n“Yes, Master. I saw him entering Sambuvaraiyar’s palace and then came back.\\nThe Prince was accorded a grand reception. I don’t have words to describe the\\nenthusiasm of the villagers who assembled on the occasion.”\\n\\n“I expected. Who else have come to the Kadambur Palace?”\\n\\n“Parthibendran and Vandhiya Thevan have come along with the Prince. Senior\\nPazhuvettaraiyar and his queen have gone from here. I heard that the Chieftains\\nfrom the Middle Provinces and Thirumunaippadi region have been invited.”\\n\\n“What about Thirukkovilur Malaiyaman?”\\n\\n\\x0c“He accompanied the Prince till Manimutha River. And then went back.”\\n\\n“The old man can’t keep quiet. He would have started gathering an army by\\nnow. I hear that the Kodumbalur Chieftain has gathered a huge army and is\\nmarching towards the Capital from South. God should save this country from\\ndanger. Thirumalai, did you hear what the people of the Chozha Kingdom are\\ntalking about?”\\n\\n“They are talking mainly about the drowning accident involving the younger\\nPrince. They are furious over Pazhuvettaraiyars. Some are even blaming you,\\nMaster.”\\n\\n“They are after all right. I deserve the blame. I am planning to resign my\\nMinister’s job.”\\n\\n“Master that would be a grand release for me! I’ll then travel to all the places\\nsinging the compositions of Azhwars. I’ll lead a happy, care-free life. Tell me,\\nMaster, when are you going to quit?\\n\\n“I am planning one last time to save this country from danger. I’ll quit my post\\nsoon after that.”\\n\\n“What are you going to do, Master?”\\n\\n“The first step of my plan has already been executed. Thirumalai you should\\nknow that I have succeeded in a task which you said is impossible for you.”\\n\\n\\x0c“That’s no surprise, Master. But what’s the task, Master?”\\n\\n“Didn’t I ask you to bring the crazy, dumb woman roaming in the Lankan\\nislands? But you said that you can’t do it.”\\n\\n“Yes, I did, Master. The dumb lady…. “\\n\\n“I brought her to my palace yesterday night.”\\n\\n“That’s nothing short of a miracle, Master. But how did you do it?”\\n\\n“I expected that dumb lady would come to Kodikkarai to know if the younger\\nPrince survived the storm. I had sent men to capture her if she resisted. Thank\\nGod, she did not give much trouble. She let herself to be brought here. And\\nThirumalai you are not going to believe this. I had her brought from\\nThiruvaiyaaru in the closed palanquin belonging to the Junior Queen of\\nPazhuvur.”\\n\\n“But, Master, there were heavy rains yesterday and possibly a storm too?”\\n\\n“Yes. That delayed her journey. I was worried. It was only after the palanquin\\nreached the Palace at midnight did I heave a sigh of relief.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Oh it was midnight when she came? And you were up, Master, till that time to\\naccord a rousing reception to her?”\\n\\n“Yes, I was awake. But I did not go to receive her. I made the womenfolk of the\\nPalace receive her. I knew she was a crazy woman. I was worried that she might\\nfight with me. Thank God nothing of that sort happened. She ate well and soon\\nslept. Thirumalai, to confess the truth, I am still afraid to see her. Thank God,\\nyou came at the right time. We can see her together.”\\n\\n“Master, I too am eager to see her.”\\n\\n“Then come, let’s go to the ladies’ chambers. I presume that the lady knows you\\nalready. She also knows that you are dear to the younger Prince. She might have\\na soft corner for you.”\\n\\nThe Master and the disciple walked to the ladies’ chambers. The Minister\\nordered the maids to bring in the woman who came in the previous night.\\n\\nThe maids brought in the lady.\\n\\nAniruddha Brahmarayar was shocked.\\n\\nThere was a sarcastic smile on Azhwarkkadian’s face.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 23 - Can a Dumb Woman Speak?\\n\\nAniruddha Brahmarayar was staring at Poonkuzhali for some time. Then he\\nsummoned the maids who brought her. In a barely audible whisper he sought\\nsome information from them. And when he got what he wanted he sent them\\naway.\\n\\nHe then turned towards Azhwarkkadian.\\n\\n“Thirumalai, something has gone wrong. Terribly wrong!”\\n\\n“I too think so, Master.”\\n\\n“This woman is quite young. She’d be twenty at the most.”\\n\\n“Not even twenty, Master.”\\n\\n“The woman I was expecting should be forty.”\\n\\n“More than that, Master.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Yes, yes. You have seen Mandhakini Devi in Lanka, right?”\\n\\n“Yes, Master. I have. And I also tried to bring her here as per your orders. But I\\ncould not.”\\n\\n“This woman is not Mandhakini Devi.”\\n\\n“No, Master. She is definitely not.”\\n\\n“Then who is this woman? And how did she come here?”\\n\\n“Why don’t we ask her, Master?”\\n\\n“What’s the point in asking a dumb woman?”\\n\\n“Gurudeva, is this lady really dumb.. .”\\n\\n“I asked the maids. They say that she has not spoken anything ever since she\\ncame here.”\\n\\n“I have a doubt, Master. Whom did you send to bring this woman?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Oh My God! You mean to say that the idiot has messed up?”\\n\\n“Which idiot, Master? I don’t think you would have sent an idiot for a critical\\nmission like this.”\\n\\n“He appeared to be smart. When I went to Pazhaiyaarai a young man fought\\nwith Vandhiya Thevan, the warrior from the Vana clan. Do you remember my\\ntelling you about him?”\\n\\n“Yes, Master. He is the son of the Chief Doctor of Pazhaiyaarai. His name is\\nPinaakapaani.”\\n\\n“The same fellow. After sending you and Vandhiya Thevan to meet Karikalan I\\ngot this fellow released from the prison. I thought he’d be ideal for our\\nespionage work. I sent him to Kodikkarai. Looks like he has visited the place\\nearlier and knows about it.”\\n\\n“You mean to say, Master that he brought this lady here?”\\n\\n“I described the woman to be brought here. I gave him all her identifying marks.\\nHe brought her to Thiruvaiyaaru and sent a message to me about the success of\\nthe mission.”\\n\\n“Master, I am dying to see the spy who succeeded in the mission in which I\\nfailed. Where is he now? Why don’t we ask this girl herself?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Good idea. But he met with an accident last night.”\\n\\n“Oh My God! What happened, Master?”\\n\\n“He was walking behind the palanquin. I had ordered them to come into the Fort\\nonly in the night. Accordingly they left Thiruvaiyaaru late in the evening and\\nreached the Fort in the early hours of night. I think you know about the sudden\\nstorm last night.”\\n\\n“Yes, Master. I too was worried about the storm. I was afraid. I took refuge in a\\nroad-side Mandapam when the storm was in full fury.”\\n\\n“When the palanquin was near the gates of the Fort a huge tree on the road-side\\nfell down. The palanquin had a narrow escape. The tree fell on those who came\\nbehind the palanquin. The Doctor’s son was caught underneath the fallen tree.”\\n\\nAs the Chief Minister was talking they heard a high pitched female voice.\\n\\n“Only the tree fell on that devil? And not the lightning? And the thunder? Very\\nsad. Very, very sad.”\\n\\nThere was so much fury in that voice. The two men turned around.\\n\\nThe Chief Minister looked at Poonkuzhali. He was surprised.\\n\\n\\x0c“Thirumalai, did this lady speak?”\\n\\n“Yes, Master. I think so.”\\n\\n“Surprise of surprises! How can a deaf girl hear, or a dumb woman speak?”\\n\\n“Yes the deaf hearing and the dumb talking are matters of great surprise. But,\\nMaster, you are an ardent devotee of that all-powerful God Vishnu. Anything can\\nhappen if only you set your mind to it. Our Azhwar says in this context.. “\\n\\n“Stop it, I say. Don’t drag the Azhwars into this. This is not due to the grace of\\nLord Vishnu. Something has gone wrong. This girl has cheated us. Who is she?\\nWhat is her motive? Why did she act like a deaf and a dumb woman all along?”\\n\\n“Why don’t we ask her Gurudeva?”\\n\\n“Thirumalai, when I see the mischievous smile dancing on your face I strongly\\nsuspect that you know everything. Ok, let me ask this woman. Hey girl, aren’t\\nyou deaf? Do you hear me?”\\n\\n“It would have been better if I had been deaf. But right now I am happy that I\\ncan hear you. Didn’t I hear you say that the devil was caught under the falling\\ntree? My Lord, tell me, is that devil dead?” - Poonkuzhali talked with fervour.\\n\\n\\x0c“Aha, you can hear. And you can talk too. So you are not dumb after all.” The\\nChief Minister pronounced with a flourish.\\n\\n“This girl is not dumb. I am so very sure about it.” Azhwarkkadian too joined\\nthe game.\\n\\n“Aha, at last you have found out that I am not dumb. I have heard that the Chief\\nMinister Aniruddha Brahmarayar is the most intelligent person in the Chozha\\nKingdom. Looks like that’s true, My Lord.”\\n\\n“Hey Girl, are you making fun of me? Beware! If you are not dumb why did you\\nact so since last night? Why didn’t you speak anything ever since you came here.\\nI want nothing but the truth. SPEAK!”\\n\\n“My Lord, I had the ability to speak till I reached your Palace yesterday night.\\nPeople at my place used to call me a chatter-box. I never stop talking. But when\\nI saw your Palace and when I received the royal hospitality from the women of\\nyour household I was stunned. Too stunned to speak, my Lord. Your women\\nspoke to me in the sign language. I thought all of them are dumb. I took pity on\\nthem and spoke to them in sign language, my Lord. Only after I heard you now\\ndid I remember that I too can speak.”\\n\\n“I have no doubt that you are a loquacious lady. I am surprised how the Doctor’s\\nson was able to capture you. He might be a fool; but in a way he’s smart.”\\n\\n“My Lord, that crook did not capture me. If only he had tried that he’d be the\\nhonourable guest of the Lord of Death by this time.”\\n\\n\\x0cPoonkuzhali drew the knife from her waist and showed it to the Chief Minister.\\n\\n“May you be blessed, Girl. But first keep the knife in its place. Why are you so\\nfurious with him? After all he did not capture you.”\\n\\n“No he did not. But his men tied me to my boat. They also tied my sister-in-law\\nto a tree. And to cap it all that devil of the Doctor’s son told me that he did not\\nhave any hand in that.”\\n\\n“To that extent at least, he’s smart. He followed my instructions to properly.”\\n\\n“Oh My God, Honourable Chief Minister, my Lord, was it you who sent that\\ncrook? Was it you who ordered that my aunt be caught and brought before you?”\\n\\n“Your aunt? Is Mandhakini your aunt? Then tell me how are you related to\\nThiagavidangar, the care-taker of the light house?”\\n\\n“I am his darling daughter, my Lord.”\\n\\n“I never knew that Thiagayavidangar has such a loquacious daughter.”\\n\\n“Will you please do me a favour?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Sure, my child.”\\n\\n“Don’t tell this to anybody.”\\n\\n“But why, girl?”\\n\\n“The whole country is praising you. They say that you know everything.\\nNothing happens in this Kingdom without your knowledge. If you proclaim your\\nignorance in a simple matter like this your reputation will go for a toss.”\\n\\n“Hey girl, I don’t care about my reputation. Now please enlighten me on\\nsomething else too. You said that your aunt was captured by some men. Do you\\nknow where they are? How did you get into the palanquin I sent for your aunt?\\nWhere did you get in?”\\n\\n“My Lord, first tell me why did you send your men to capture my aunt, a dumb,\\nharmless and an innocent woman.”\\n\\n“I can’t reveal that to you, my dear daughter. That’s classified information.”\\n\\n“My dear father, then I too can’t answer your question.”\\n\\n“I know how to make you talk.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Your methods won’t work with me.”\\n\\n“I can send you to the underground dungeons.”\\n\\n“No prison can hold me.”\\n\\n“No one who has gone to the underground dungeons has come back. It’s a point\\nof no return.”\\n\\n“Wrong, again, my Lord. I know a person who came back from the underground\\ndungeons. Even yesterday I was travelling with Chendan Amudhan. I was\\ntalking to him all the way.”\\n\\n“Who is Chendan Amudhan?”\\n\\n“He is the son of my other aunt. We two were travelling from Kodikkarai\\ntogether.”\\n\\n“What for, my child?”\\n\\n“To see the palaces, mansions and other high rise buildings of Thanjavur. I’ve\\nwanted to see them for quite some time. I also wanted to meet the Emperor. I\\nheard that the Emperor is sick. How is he doing now? Can I see him, my Lord?”\\n\\n\\x0c“There’s no improvement in his condition, my child. So, please forget meeting\\nhim.”\\n\\n“How can I, my Lord? I have to see him. I should tell him that women are not\\nsafe in his great country, that they are forcibly kidnapped by people in power.”\\n\\n“Hey girl, I don’t have the time to argue with you. My orders were not to capture\\nyou. Tell me first how you got into the palanquin I sent for somebody else. Did\\nsomebody force you into the palanquin?”\\n\\n“No, my Lord. When I was near the Thanjavur Fort I saw a vacant palanquin. It\\nwas raining outside. Just to escape from the rain I got into it.”\\n\\nThe Minister now spoke to his disciple.\\n\\n“I now understand. They must have kept the palanquin down during heavy rain.\\nAt that time this girl must have changed places with her aunt. The Doctor’s son\\nwas under the tree and was unconscious. He could not have noticed the change\\nof occupants. Nor did the bearers see the women trading their places. This must\\nhave happened near the Fort. Thirumalai, is my guess right?”\\n\\n“Perfect, Master! I saw that happening with my own eyes.”\\n\\n“WHAT? DID YOU SEE THAT? Then why didn’t you say that earlier? Tell me\\nwhat happened.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Yesterday night I was walking towards the Fort. It was raining heavily. Trees\\nwere falling down. I decided to stay for a while in a road-side mandapam. Soon\\nafter I went in, this girl and a young man came in. That man must be her cousin.\\nIn the flash of lightning I saw the beads on his chest. I thought he must be a\\nstrong Saivite. I wanted to talk about the greatness of Vaishnavism to him, more\\nto while away the time than anything else.\\n\\n“Meanwhile some men brought a palanquin into the mandapam. I saw the Palm\\nTree insignia on the screen of the palanquin. A lady got down from the\\npalanquin. These three people - I mean the lady, this girl and the young man were talking to each other in sign language in the cover of darkness. Then I saw\\nthis girl getting into the palanquin. From the frequent flashes of lightning I could\\nfind out that the person who got into the palanquin was different from the one\\nwho got out. The bearers did not notice the change. When the rain stopped they\\ncarried the palanquin away from the mandapam.”\\n\\n“Aha! They have cheated me! But why did you keep quiet till now? What\\nhappened to those two people?”\\n\\n“They left the place a few minutes after the palanquin. I too left the place.”\\n\\n“Thirumalai, why were you a silent spectator? Why didn’t you stop this girl’s\\naunt? Are you a part of their conspiracy?”\\n\\n“Oh My God! What words, my Master! I won’t even think of committing such a\\ncruel betrayal. First, I never knew that you were behind the abduction drama.\\nBecause the palanquin belonged to the Pazhuvur Palace. So I thought that the\\nJunior Pazhuvettaraiyar was abducting that lady. Moreover how can I stop\\n\\n\\x0cMandhakini Devi? One can even stop the storm; but not the Mute Queen,\\nMaster. I have tried that in Lanka and have failed. Again, the lady knows me. If\\nshe sees me she’d run away. Then nobody can get her.”\\n\\n“Coming to think of it, I feel that the Doctor’s son was a lot smarter than you. He\\nhas at least brought the lady up to here.”\\n\\n“Master, your inference is not right in this matter. Mandhakini Devi would have\\ncome on her own. And must have changed her mind at the last moment, when\\nshe was near Thanjavur.”\\n\\n“May be! She could not have gone far by now. It was raining almost for the\\nwhole of last night. She should be somewhere near here. Thirumalai, we should\\nsomehow get her here. Perhaps this girl may know where she is staying. Hey\\ngirl, what’s your name?”\\n\\n“Poonkuzhali, My Lord.”\\n\\n“Aha, what a beautiful name! When it comes to giving names to his children\\nthere is nobody who can beat Thyagavidangar. Poonkuzhali, you know where\\nyour aunt will be now. If you do, please let me know. I promise you we won’t\\nharm her.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali thought for some time.\\n\\n“My Lord, I know where she will be now. If you tell me why you sent your men\\n\\n\\x0cto capture her I will share her whereabouts with you.”\\n\\n“Poonkuzhali, that’s a politically sensitive issue. It’s about a secret that concerns\\nthe Palace. I can’t share that with you.”\\n\\n“Then I can’t tell you where she is.”\\n\\n“There’s no point in talking to this headstrong girl.”\\n\\n“My Lord, if you accept my condition.. .. “\\n\\n“Aha, see this girl is trying to impose a condition.. on me… Okay, tell me what’s\\nyour condition? “\\n\\n“If you promise me that you’ll make my aunt sit on the Chozha Throne and wear\\nthe crown of the Chozha Empress I’ll bring her here.”\\n\\n“Thirumalai, this girl has gone crazy.”\\n\\n“Did you find that out only now, Master? Too late, Master. There is no need to\\nask her. I know where her aunt will be now. Her cousin Chendan Amudhan lives\\nin a garden which is outside the gates of the Fort. He and his mother serve the\\nThalikkulathar temple by offering flowers for God. The woman you are looking\\nfor is at their place. If you send some men with me I’ll bring her here in no time,\\nMaster.”\\n\\n\\x0cPoonkuzhali stared daggers at Azhwarkkadian.\\n\\n“If you try to do that I’ll complain to the Emperor. I’ll see to it that your\\natrocities are known to the whole town.”\\n\\n“Thirumalai, we have to send her to the underground dungeons. There is no\\nother way.”\\n\\n“If anybody comes near me I’ll kill him.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali took out the knife from her waist and held it in a threatening\\nfashion.\\n\\n“Master, there is no need to send this girl to the dungeons. Instead we can send\\nher to Princess Kunthavai’s palace. I think Princess Kunthavai is here in this city\\nat this moment. She’d cure this crazy girl. Perhaps she might want to get a few\\nthings done through this girl.”\\n\\n“Why do you say that? How can this silly girl help Princess Kunthavai?”\\n\\n“You don’t know, Master? The storm which we had here last night has wrought\\nhavoc in the coastal area of Chozha Kingdom. Messengers have come to you\\nfrom all the four directions bearing the bad news.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Yes, yes. Thanks for reminding me. I need to see them now. I’ve lost precious\\ntime talking to this silly girl. It could have been better if this girl had been born\\ndumb.”\\n\\n“Then you can carry on with your misdeeds with nobody to question you, right?”\\n- Poonkuzhali spat fire.\\n\\n“Master, Nagapattinam is in great danger. I hear that that the sea has come into\\nthe town and the whole town is submerged.”\\n\\nBoth the Minister and Poonkuzhali were shocked by these words.\\n\\n“It’s quite possible, Master, that the Princess Kunthavai herself may come here\\nto enquire about the calamity.”\\n\\nAs Azhwarkkadian was saying that they could hear people hailing somebody.\\n\\n“Thirumalai, when did you get the Third Eye? When did you get the ability to\\nsee the future? You are right. Looks like the Princess has arrived at my gates!”\\n\\nThe Chief Minister walked to the gates of his Palace.\\n\\nKunthavai and Vanathi entered his palace through the same gate.\\n\\n\\x0cWhen the Princess saw Poonkuzhali her face brightened. The look of concern\\nand grief vanished from her face. Her beautiful face now shone with a feeling of\\nsurprise and happiness.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 24 - The Anxiety Of The Princess\\n\\nThe Minister welcomed Princess Kunthavai and Princess Vanathi and gave them\\nproper seats befitting their royal stature.\\n\\n“Your Highness, if only you had sent word to me I’d have come to see you. May\\nI know the reason for this unexpected visit? Anything urgent, Devi? I hope the\\nEmperor is doing fine.”\\n\\n“The Emperor’s health is as usual. But he is unduly worried. He is very much\\ndisturbed by the storm and did not have a wink of sleep last night. He is anxious\\nabout the safety and well-being of the people, especially the poor people living\\nin huts. He was talking about them all night. He almost ordered me to see you at\\ndawn and request you to immediately provide assistance on a war footing to\\nthose who have been affected by the storm. I came here mainly to convey my\\nfather’s message to you.”\\n\\n“What can this humble servant do, Your Highness? You know that I am the\\nChief Minister only in name. The Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar, who is the Chancellor\\nof the Exchequer, is unfortunately not in the city at this moment. I am sure he\\nwould have locked up the Royal Treasury and would have carried the keys with\\nhim. Even his own brother, the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar cannot open the treasury\\nwithout the Senior’s consent. What help can I offer the poor and distressed,\\nDevi? Your Highness might have seen scores of people waiting outside the gates\\nof my palace. I am ashamed to see them, Devi. That’s why I am hesitant to even\\nmove out of my room.”\\n\\n“You need not worry on that count, Minister. I’ll give all my personal belongings\\n\\n\\x0cfor the relief work. My mother too is ready to give her personal assets. And you\\ncan take all the valuables in the Emperor’s Palace for the purpose. The Emperor\\nauthorises you to do that. Please do something to provide at least some kind of a\\ntemporary relief to those who are affected by the calamity.”\\n\\n“Doing relief work with your personal assets will be like providing a single corn\\nto the hungry elephant. The storm has affected the whole of the kingdom. We are\\nyet to receive information about the extent of damage. And this man standing\\nhere, my most ardent disciple, Azhwarkkadian, has brought terrible news. He\\nsays that the sea has entered the cities and has drowned all the coastal towns\\nfrom Kodikkarai to Nagapattinam.”\\n\\nThe Minister did not fail to observe the waves of shock that passed through the\\nfaces of the three women standing before him.\\n\\nHe now spoke in a soothing voice:\\n\\n“But I don’t believe his words, Your Highness. What he says is a rumour. As it\\nusually happens, rumours travel faster than a cyclone. It is not possible to get\\ninformation from the coastal towns so soon. Even if soldiers travel on the fastest\\nhorses the news won’t reach here before this afternoon. Meanwhile we can do\\nwhatever is possible from our end.”\\n\\nPrincess Kunthavai struggled hard to calm herself.\\n\\n“Minister Sir, I too heard the rumours about Nagapattinam. I have come to talk\\nabout that as well. Didn’t we grant some endowments to the Choodamani\\nMonastery recently? And if the monastery is in danger, what will those poor\\n\\n\\x0cmonks do?”\\n\\nWith these words she threw a pointed glance at Poonkuzhali.\\n\\n“Minister Sir, how did this girl come here? Isn’t she the daughter of Kodikkarai\\nThiagavidangar?”\\n\\n“She is, Your Highness. But she is not soft-natured like her father. She has the\\nnasty habit of poking her nose in to matters totally unrelated to her, embarrassing\\neveryone around.”\\n\\nPrincess Kunthavai grew suspicious. Perhaps the Chief Minister had brought\\nPoonkuzhali only to spy on the whereabouts of Prince Arulmozhivarman. She\\nhad grounds for her doubt. The Chief Minister was known for his smart tricks\\nand intelligent manoeuvres. She decided to take sides with Poonkuzhali.\\n\\n“No, Minister Sir. I don’t agree with your assessment of her. Poonkuzhali is a\\nnice girl. Poonkuzhali, come here. Why is the Chief Minister angry with you?\\nDid you give him any trouble?”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali came near Kunthavai.\\n\\n“Devi, why don’t you ask the Chief Minister himself? Did I give trouble to him\\nor did he give trouble to me?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Ok, dear. You too appear to be angry. Come closer, my girl. Come, sit by my\\nside.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali obeyed.\\n\\n“Minister Sir, why did you bring this girl here? Anything important?”\\n\\n“Your Highness, I did not bring this girl here. I did not even know that such a\\nnaughty girl lives in our kingdom. It’s all her making. She... came... ”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali spat fire.\\n\\n“Devi, why should the Honourable Minister be hesitant to reveal the truth? Ask\\nhim to tell the whole story.”\\n\\nThe Minister spoke.\\n\\n“She came on her own looking out for her aunt.”\\n\\n“Who is her aunt? Oh, Chendan Amudhan’s mother? I think their house is\\noutside the Fort.”\\n\\n“No, Your Highness. I am not referring to Amudhan’s mother. This girl has\\n\\n\\x0canother aunt who is also dumb and deaf. You might have heard of a crazy, dumb\\nwoman wandering in the Lankan forests. I wanted to bring her here for an\\nimportant work. I tried my best to do that. I almost succeeded. But you know in\\nthe last minute... this girl... “\\n\\nKunthavai’s excitement was beyond description.\\n\\n“Oh My God! Is it true? Where is that lady? I want to see her right now!” The\\nPrincess got up from her seat.\\n\\n“Please forgive me, Your Highness. This girl spoilt everything at the last\\nminute.”\\n\\nKunthavai sat down disappointed. She then turned to Poonkuzhali.\\n\\n“Is that true, Poonkuzhali? You’d never know what you have done.”\\n\\n“Devi, please ask the Minister what kind of tactics he employed to bring my\\naunt. Then you won’t blame me.”\\n\\nThe Chief Minister gave a brief account of the events.\\n\\nPrincess Kunthavai listened to him with rapt attention. Finally she declared\\n\\n\\x0c“Minister Sir, then she should be somewhere near the Fort. Why don’t you send\\nyour men to look out for her?”\\n\\n“Thank God there is no need to search for her. My disciple here says that she is\\nin Chendan Amudhan’s hut. And that my disciple saw her this morning.”\\n\\n“Then what are waiting for, Minister Sir? Let other things wait. Let’s go. Let’s\\nbring her here. If you are busy, I’ll go myself. Vanathi, let’s go!”\\n\\nAzhwarkkadian intervened.\\n\\n“Let’s think before we act, Devi. If the lady sees strangers coming in a group she\\nmight be frightened and she’ll run away. It is easy to capture the cyclone but not\\nthat woman.”\\n\\nThe Minister endorsed his disciple’s views.\\n\\n“What my disciple says is correct. Poonkuzhali’s aunt might run away if she sees\\nus as a group. Then all our efforts would go waste. What is your suggestion,\\nThirumalai?”\\n\\n“Ask this girl Poonkuzhali to bring her here. There are only two people in the\\nwhole world whom the Mute Queen will listen to. One of them is this girl.”\\n\\n“The other?” - Chief Minister was anxious to know.\\n\\n\\x0cAzhwarkkadian hesitated for a while.\\n\\n“There’s a rumour that the other person is drowned in the sea.”\\n\\nKunthavai pretended not to have listened to Azhwarkkadian’s words. She\\naddressed Poonkuzhali.\\n\\n“Dear Poonkuzhali, please bring your aunt here. I promise you that she won’t be\\nhurt. I need to see her on a very important work. Will you do it for me?”\\n\\n“Yes, Your Highness! But the Chief Minister ought not to have employed such\\ncheap tactics to bring her here. If only I had known this earlier... “\\n\\n“Yes, I do agree. When there is no transparency in our acts these lapses do occur.\\nI have learnt that myself in a hard way. I am sorry. Bring your aunt here quickly.\\nAnd you have one more work.” - Kunthavai’s words were soft and conciliatory.\\n\\nThe Chief Minister now addressed his favourite disciple.\\n\\n“Thirumalai you go with this girl. If you experience any trouble in entering the\\nFort you can come to my Palace through the secret way.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali and Azhwarkkadian took leave of everyone and went away.\\n\\n\\x0cPrincess Kunthavai now spoke to the Chief Minister.\\n\\n“Minister Sir, you have a lot of visitors. Tell them what needs to be told. Send\\nthem away and come back. I want your advice on some crucial matters.”\\n\\n“Give me a few minutes, Your Highness. I too need to talk to you.”\\n\\nThe Minister went away.\\n\\nVanathi opened her mouth for the first time.\\n\\n“Akka, what is the other important work you have in mind for Poonkuzhali? Are\\nyou planning to send her again to Nagapattinam?”\\n\\n“Yes, Vanathi. But don’t let that trouble you. Nothing will happen to Ponniyin\\nSelvan.”\\n\\n“Let me also go with her to Nagapattinam, Akka.”\\n\\n“What will you do there, Vanathi? Then I need somebody else to guard you.”\\n\\n“That boat-woman hates me, Akka.”\\n\\n\\x0c“How did you read her mind?”\\n\\n“She never talked to me. Not even once.”\\n\\n“You also did not talk to her. And she did not talk to you.”\\n\\n“I was looking at her face every now and then. But she did not look at me at all.\\nNot even once! She seems angry with me. I don’t know why.”\\n\\n“Yes, Vanathi. All the maidens in this country will be jealous of you. There is no\\npoint in grieving over it.”\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 25 - The Chief Minister’s Fault’\\n\\nThe Chief Minister disposed of the visitors at the gates of his palace quite fast\\nand almost ran back to the Princess.\\n\\n“Devi, I have done whatever is possible under the circumstances. I have sent\\nmen in all the directions to assess the damages caused by the storm. I have also\\nsent word to the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar. I have requested him to open up the\\nRoyal Treasury and leave it under our joint custody.”\\n\\n“Minister Sir, I hear that there is an underground treasure house near the Senior\\nPazhuvettaraiyar’s house. Is it true that it holds invaluable treasures? The Queen\\nMother spoke to me about it.”\\n\\n“The Queen Mother thinks that if that treasure is thrown open we can build a\\nthousand temples in the country. I am the Chief Minister; but I have not seen it.\\nNot even once, Devi. People who go there never come back alive.”\\n\\n“Let it wait. Will those two bring the Mute Queen safely? I am worried that\\nhaving come thus far we might let her slip out of our hands.”\\n\\n“Your Highness, what do you know about that good lady? And how? Why are\\nyou so excited about her?”\\n\\n“Minister Sir, the Emperor spoke about her a few days ago.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Oh My God! Did he tell you that she is alive?”\\n\\n“No, he did not. He recounted what happened twenty five years ago. The\\nEmperor thinks that she is dead. That explains his troubled state of mind. He told\\nme that it was you who conveyed the death news to the Emperor. Didn’t you tell\\nmy father that the lady jumped into the sea and killed herself? Then how did you\\nknow that the lady is still alive?”\\n\\n“I was about to ask the same question to you, Your Highness? How did you\\nknow, Devi?”\\n\\n“I have no qualms in sharing that with you, Minister Sir. The Warrior of the\\nVaana Clan who had been to Lanka told me about her. And then my brother\\nArulmozhi... “\\n\\nKunthavai realized her mistake and bit her lips.\\n\\n“Your Highness, if you do not want to talk to me about Arulmozhivarman let it\\nbe so. I will forget your mentioning his name in our conversation.”\\n\\n“No, Minister Sir, I have decided to come clean on everything. That’s why I\\ncame here. There is no point in hiding things. It gives rise to unnecessary\\ndangers and complications. I realized the truth of this statement last night. Please\\nlisten, Sir. My brother did not drown in the sea. He was saved by the King of the\\nSea, the Samudrarajan himself. He is now safe in the Choodamani Buddhist\\nMonastery at Nagapattinam. I had been to Nagappattinam only to see him. I\\n\\n\\x0calways had a doubt that you knew everything.”\\n\\n“Your doubts are justified, Devi. But I never showed that I knew. I have a policy\\nnot to interfere in any of your matters, Devi. I have spared nobody but you,\\nDevi. I have given orders to my men that they should never poke their noses in\\nwhatever you do. I strongly believe that you’ll always be just and right.\\nMalaiyaman and I used to talk a lot about you. We used to say that had our\\nPrincess Kunthavai been born a man she would have brought the whole world\\nunder Chozha rule.”\\n\\n“I confess that I too had a similar ambition. Though I was born a woman I\\nwanted to fulfill my ambition through my brothers. But now I have abandoned\\nmy desires. I have come to the firm conclusion that women should never\\ninterfere in the political affairs of a country. It was me who made my brother\\nstay in the Buddhist Monastery at Nagappattinam. See what has happened!”\\n\\n“Nothing has happened, Devi. The King of the Sea was kind enough to rescue\\nthe Prince when he was drowning in mid sea. Do you think he will hurt him\\nwhen he is on the shores, safe and secure?”\\n\\n“Minister Sir, I want you to tell these words to my father. He is devastated.”\\n\\n“Aha! Does the Emperor know that the Prince is in Choodamani Monastery?”\\n\\n“I told him yesterday. I had to. There was no other go.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Oh My God! We could have delayed telling him for a few more days. I thought\\nyour arrangement was brilliant. Devi, the entire country is fuming now. There\\nwas an external storm last night. But an internal storm has been raging in the\\nminds of our people for quite some time. People are furious over\\nMadhuranthakan and the Pazhuvettaraiyar brothers. People have come to know\\nthat it was the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar who sent ships to arrest the Prince. They\\nalso believe that it was the Pazhuvettaraiyars who killed the Prince. If the people\\nknow that the Prince is alive they will rise to action. There will be a mutiny. The\\npeople would want the Prince to be crowned right now. They won’t stop till the\\nPrince is made the Emperor.\\n\\nThe Pazhuvettaraiyars are waiting for some lame excuses to start a war. The\\nSenior Velar of Kodumbalur is marching to the capital with a huge army. I am\\nafraid that there is going to be bloodshed in a hitherto unknown scale in our\\nKingdom. I fear that this great Kingdom might be destroyed by sibling rivalry. I\\nhave been praying to Lord Renganatha day and night to avert that calamity.”\\n\\n“My prayers are also the same. I don’t want any of my brothers to ascend the\\nthrone. I have killed that desire long back. I don’t have any objection to\\nMadhuranthakan being crowned as the King.”\\n\\n“You may not object, Devi. But the people will. By God’s grace the Emperor\\nshould live for many, many years. But if anything happens.... well... on that day\\nthere will be a great mutiny… “\\n\\n“Minister Sir, I am afraid that the terrible event might happen pretty early.\\nYesterday the Emperor’s condition was quite serious. I was forced to tell him\\nthat Ponniyin Selvan was safe and sound. But he did not believe my words. He\\nthought I was just giving him empty words of consolation. He is still under the\\nhallucination that the ghost of that ‘evil woman’ is taking revenge on his sons.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Oh My God! Devi, can you please tell me what happened last night?”\\n\\n“I came here only for that, Minister Sir. I also want to seek your advice on some\\nissues. Do you remember that once I came here to establish Sundara Chozha\\nHospital here in the capital? At that time the Emperor told me his life story.\\nWhen he accidentally took refuge in an island near Lanka, a fisherwoman saved\\nhim from a charging bear. And then he lived a dream-life with that girl in that\\nheavenly island. After some time he was taken to Thanjavur. He also remembers\\nseeing her in the crowd at the time of his coronation. And then he sent his best\\nfriend, that is you, Minister Sir, to bring her. You went in search of her and then\\ncame back to report that she fell into the sea and died. From then on he has been\\ntelling that her ghost visits him often to torment him. And of late the ghost is\\ncoming often. That’s what he told me last night.”\\n\\n“But Devi, do you believe him?”\\n\\n“The story was quite unusual. Yes, I was confused. I first thought that the\\nEmperor had lost his mind. Otherwise he would not complain about the ghost of\\nthe dead woman visiting him often. But as I started to think of those events I had\\nother doubts. One day my friend Vanathi heard the Emperor screaming. She ran\\nto his room. She saw a figure closely resembling the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur\\nstanding before the Emperor. The shock was too much for her. She fainted. From\\nthen on I started having doubts about the relationship between the Mute Queen\\nand the Pazhuvur Queen. My doubts were confirmed by what Vandhiya Thevan\\nand Arulmozhivarman said. Is Nandini Devi the mute woman’s daughter?”\\n\\n“I too had those doubts, Devi. If we just consider the similarity in appearance\\nthat inference is inevitable. But can we decide solely on that? Nandini Devi\\ncould even be the mute woman’s youngest sister. There are only three people in\\nthe world who know about the relationship.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Who are they?”\\n\\n“The first is the Queen Mother, Sembian Madevi. She is guarding a secret in her\\nheart which is eating her insides. But we can’t know what it is unless the Queen\\nMother herself chooses to share it with us. She revealed it to Emperor\\nKandaraathithar at the time of his death. Kandaraathithar started telling that\\nsecret to me. But before he could hardly speak two words he gasped for breath\\nand died.”\\n\\n“Who are the other two, Minister Sir?”\\n\\n“The other two can’t speak. One is Chendan Amudhan’s mother. And the other is\\nher elder sister, the Mute Queen. We can’t get anything from Amudhan’s mother.\\nShe is fiercely loyal to Sembian Madevi. So long as the Queen Mother is alive\\nshe won’t reveal the secret. That was the reason I took great efforts to bring\\nMandhakini from Lanka.”\\n\\n“Oh, her name is Mandhakini? How did you know that she was alive?”\\n\\n“Devi, I knew that twenty five years ago.”\\n\\n“WHAT? YOU KNEW THAT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO? Then why didn’t\\nyou tell my father? Because my father believes that she is dead he has been\\nsuffering. And you know that very well, Minister Sir?”\\n\\n“I know, Devi. I know.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Even after knowing that why did you hide the truth from him?”\\n\\nAniruddhar let out a long sigh. From his facial expression Kunthavai could\\ngather that his mind was in a state of turbulence. The Chief Minister started a\\nlong narration:\\n\\n“Devi, I committed an offence twenty five years ago. I am confessing it to you\\nfor the first time. Nobody else in this world knows this. Yes, your father sent me\\nto look out for that fisherman’s daughter. I went with some horsemen. We\\nreached Kodikkarai. We learnt that she jumped into the turbulent sea from the\\nlight house. There were eye-witnesses to that ghastly act. Thiagavidangar, the\\ncaretaker of the light house, recounted the event in a trembling voice. I came\\nback to Thanjavur and conveyed the news to my dear friend.”\\n\\n“I don’t see your fault in any of these, Minister Sir.”\\n\\n“Well, this is my offence. The fisherman’s daughter fell into the sea. But she did\\nnot die. A fisherman rescued her. He took her in his boat. And he reached the\\nshore several miles away from Kodikkarai. As we were coming back from\\nKodikkarai I saw the boat coming in. I saw the woman in the boat. I knew who\\nshe was. I gave loads of money to the boatman and requested him to take her\\nsafely to Lanka and keep her there. I came back to Thanjavur and told the\\nEmperor that the fisherman’s daughter was dead. I thought I was helping your\\nfather. I never thought that my lie would lead to such disaster.”\\n\\nThe Princess intervened.\\n\\n\\x0c“Minister Sir, in a way that looks like your fault. But you did it with all good\\nintentions. But tell me this; did you get any news about her?”\\n\\n“Yes, I’ve been hearing about her. As soon as Sundara Chozhan was made a\\nCrown Prince he went to the battlefront at Madurai. I went to Varanasi. I stayed\\nthere for a few years to learn our scriptures. I returned to Pazhaiyaarai after some\\ntime. One day I saw the father of Eesana Bhattar chatting with the fisherwoman.\\nHe revealed another secret to me. He told me that the fisherwoman stayed in the\\ngarden attached to the Queen Mother’s palace for some time. And that she gave\\nbirth to twins and then ran away from the place. He also told me that she used to\\ncome once in a way to see her children. I asked him about the children. He\\nrefused to say anything about them. He told me that it was a secret known only\\nto the Queen Mother. I did not want to press him further.\\n\\nDevi, when Arulmozhi was a child he fell into the Cauvery River. People used to\\nsay he was saved by Mother Cauvery. But in reality he was saved only by the\\nfisherwoman. I knew this even at that time.”\\n\\n“What you say is true, Minister Sir. Arulmozhi saw the kind lady in Lanka and\\ntold me the same thing. But listen to this! Do you know what my father thinks?\\nHe thinks that the ghost of the fisherwoman comes often to wreak vengeance on\\nhis children. Last night when the great storm was raging outside, the storm\\ninside my father’s mind was no less. He did not sleep even for a second. He did\\nnot let me sleep as well. He told me the old story once again.\\n\\n‘That devil is seeking revenge. It was that devil who killed my Arulmozhi by\\ndrowning him in a storm. And she won’t rest till she kills Karikalan.’ He kept\\nsaying this again and again.\\n\\nHe then passionately pleaded with the Lord of Death - “Please take me from this\\n\\n\\x0cworld when at least one of my sons is alive.”\\n\\nI consoled him. He did not listen. Finally I had no option but to tell him that\\nArulmozhivarman is safe in the Buddhist Monastery at Nagappattinam.”\\n\\n“Was the emperor peaceful after that?”\\n\\n“No, Minister Sir. He became even more agitated. First he did not believe the\\nnews. But then I told him that I saw the Prince in person. He asked me why I\\nhave not brought him here. I told him that he was not well and was not fit\\nenough for the long journey. And that I’ll make arrangements for his journey as\\nsoon as he recovers from the illness. I also hinted about the complications that\\nwould follow if Arulmozhi appears on the scene now. As soon as he heard this\\nhis mind went in a different direction.\\n\\n‘It’s this Kingdom that has become a problem to my children. If it is made clear\\nthat the throne is not for my children then they will live happily for a long time.\\nThat’s why I am anxious to bring them here and tell them that the throne is not\\nfor any of them.’\\n\\nSuddenly he had another fear. The hurricane was so unusually strong that even\\nthe Palace was a little shaken. Once after a huge thunder blast my father became\\nvery emotional.\\n\\n’My dear daughter I may not see Arulmozhi again. I know about the storms and\\nwhirlwinds of the Eastern seas. Today’s storm will make the waves near the\\nshore rise up to the height of a coconut tree. The sea will enter into the land and\\nlarge areas will be submerged under water. You know one day, long ago one of\\n\\n\\x0cour towns Kaveripattinam went under the sea. Similarly the sea may enter\\nNagappattinam and gobble up the city. The Buddhist Monastery which is\\nbetween the sea and the canal can never escape the storm. That devil of a lady\\ncould not drown him in the sea. Instead she is bringing sea into the land to claim\\nhis life. I am going now to foil her attempts.’\\n\\n“My father was crying like a child, Minister Sir. He tried to get up from his bed.\\nAnd then became weak again and lied down. Minister Sir, if you happen to hear\\nthe lamentations of my father. . . Well. .. Well… even the stone and the\\nmountains will melt.”\\n\\nThere was an unending stream of tears from her eyes.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 26 - The Commotion In The Streets\\n\\nVanathi could not bear to see Princess Kunthavai crying. She too started to cry.\\nAniruddha Brahmarayar had an iron heart. He had seen many a summer and had\\nbeen seasoned by the woes and worries of lives in high places. Even then his\\nheart melted on seeing the tears in the eyes of the Princesses.\\n\\n“Your Highness, I am the one who is responsible for all the sufferings of your\\nfather. I don’t know what atonement I have to do to wash away the sin.”\\n\\n“Minister Sir, you know everything. And yet I venture to tell you what little I\\nknow. If only you can tell my father that the fisherwoman is not dead, he will\\nfind peace. His heartaches will vanish. I came here only to make that request to\\nyou. I also came to request you to somehow bring my stepmother. But now I see\\nthat you are already on the job.”\\n\\n“I too had come to that conclusion, Devi. I had decided to tell the Emperor that\\nMandhakini Devi is alive. But he won’t believe my words. How can I make him\\nbelieve that whatever I told him earlier was a lie and that what I am going to tell\\nhim now is the truth? That was the reason I delayed telling your father till I\\nbrought the lady here. And if the Emperor sees her in person he will have no\\nchoice but to believe, right? I went to the Lankan Island precisely for that reason.\\nBut the Pazhuvettaraiyars twisted the story. They told the Emperor that I was\\nconspiring with your brother, Prince Arulmozhivarman and the Senior Velar of\\nKodumbalur to dethrone the Emperor. At least to prove my innocence I have to\\ntake Mandhakini Devi to your father, Devi.”\\n\\n“But if my father sees her all of a sudden, will he be able to withstand the shock?\\n\\n\\x0cI think we need to first prepare him for the meeting.”\\n\\n“Yes, Devi, I had planned that too. I had planned to talk to the Emperor as soon\\nas Mandhakini Devi is brought to this place. I had even planned to come to the\\nPalace to meet the Emperor this morning. But Thiagavidangar’s daughter\\nintervened and spoilt everything. I will see to it that the naughty girl is punished\\nsomeday.”\\n\\n“Please, Minister Sir, please spare her. I don’t know whether she is good or bad.\\nBut she is the one who saved Arulmozhivarman from drowning.”\\n\\n“God saved him, Devi. The one who is forever sleeping in the Ocean of Milk,\\nthe Great Vishnu saved the Prince. This little girl could not have done anything\\nwithout God’s help. If astrology is true, if stars and planets tell us about the\\nfuture then even the fire and the floods, the storm and the earthquake cannot\\nharm the Prince.”\\n\\n“Nothing can happen without God’s grace. But even His grace has to come only\\nthrough human beings. I had planned to send Poonkuzhali to Nagapattinam. But\\nif you think otherwise... if you think that bringing the Prince here will be a better\\noption... well... “\\n\\n“No, Devi. Till the issue of succession is fully resolved let not the country know\\nabout the Prince. I am planning to discuss the issue with the Emperor. If he\\nwants Madhuranthakan to be crowned as the King then it is better to send away\\nArulmozhi to Lanka again. People will never accept Madhuranthakan as the\\nKing so long as Prince Arulmozhivarman is here. There will be a civil war.\\nBlood will be flowing in the rivers of Chozha Kingdom.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Oh My God! Then do you think it will be a good idea to send Chendan\\nAmudhan and Poonkuzhali to Nagapattinam?”\\n\\n“I do, Your Highness. And if need be we can make Prince Arulmozhivarman to\\nvisit the capital city in cognito.”\\n\\n“You are right, Minister Sir. If my father sees Mandhakini Devi and Arulmozhi,\\nand is convinced that both of them are alive, he will be peaceful.”\\n\\n“Does your father worry about the Crown Prince, Devi?”\\n\\n“No, not at all. The Emperor is convinced that nobody in the world can harm\\nKarikalan. What is your take on this, Minister Sir?”\\n\\n“Honestly, Devi, I don’t believe that. I agree that the Crown Prince is invincible\\nin the battle field. But it is not difficult to deceive him elsewhere. The\\nPazhuvettaraiyars are against him. The Junior Queen of Pazhuvur is engaged in a\\nconspiracy against the Crown Prince. I managed to communicate the news to the\\nCrown Prince through my disciple Azhwarkkadian. But my mission is a failure,\\nDevi. The Crown Prince refused to visit the capital city in spite of repeated\\ninvitations from the Emperor; but he has now gone to Kadambur\\nSambuvaraiyar’s Palace.”\\n\\n“Minister Sir, I have sent news to my brother Karikalan that the Junior Queen of\\nPazhuvur might probably be our sister. I have also requested the warrior from\\nVaana clan to guard the Crown Prince and never leave his side. If only Vandhiya\\nThevan were here.... we could have sent him to Nagapattinam.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Then I would have sent my disciple to make sure that the young man is not\\ncaught in trouble. Even now if you decide to send Poonkuzhali I’d like to send\\nmy disciple Thirumalai.”\\n\\n“But they have gone to fetch Mandhakini Devi. They haven’t come yet. If my\\nstep mother comes here, most of my problems will go away. And when the lady\\ncomes you’ll immediately bring her to my father, right? I need to tell my mother\\nthe whole story. I need some time to prepare her for the most emotional meeting\\nof her life.”\\n\\n“Aha! My heart goes for your mother, the daughter of Malaiyaman. What an\\nagony for her! When your mother’s father the old man of Thirukkovilur knows\\nabout this... Oh My God! I can’t even guess how he will react. And if he knows\\nthat his grand children are not going to be Kings he might even be prepared to\\ndestroy the whole Kingdom.”\\n\\n“Leave the job of pacifying my grandfather to me, Minister Sir. I am worried\\nabout the Senior Velar of Kodumbalur, who happens to be this girl Vanathi’s\\nuncle. He is waiting for the day the Kodumbalur girl is going to adorn the\\nChozha Throne. I am sure even this girl wants the position.”\\n\\nVanathi shouted in fury “AKKA... “\\n\\nBefore Vanathi could talk any further, Poonkuzhali walked in. All of them were\\nshocked to see her coming alone.\\n\\n\\x0c“Hey girl! Where is your aunt? And where is Thirumalai?” - The Chief Minister\\nwas tense.\\n\\n“Sorry, Minister Sir, my pride has taken a severe blow. I could not bring her here\\nas promised.”\\n\\n“What happened? Did she vanish before you went there? Or did she refuse to\\ncome? Then. .. “\\n\\n“No, Sir. We brought her into the Fort. Then she was caught in the crowd of\\npeople and disappeared.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali gave the full details:\\n\\nFortunately for them Mandhakini Devi was in Chendan Amudhan’s house. And\\nshe had reason to do so. Amudhan’s hut had been shattered in the storm. A tree\\nhad fallen on the hut. Chendhan Amudhan who was completely drenched in the\\nrain was down with high fever. He was in a state of delirium. The two sisters Amudhan’s mother and his aunt - were busy removing the tree and cleaning up\\nthe house. Mandhakini was pleased to see Poonkuzhali again. But she was a tad\\nhesitant to meet Thirumalai. Poonkuzhali explained to her that Thirumalai was\\non their side. Mandhakini was pacified.\\n\\nPoonkuzhali and Thirumalai had discussed how to present the case to\\nMandhakini even while walking to Amudhan’s house. Poonkuzhali faithfully\\ncarried out the plan. Accordingly she told the Mute Queen that the Emperor was\\nin his death bed and that his end might come any time. And that he wanted to see\\nMandhakini before he breathed his last. She also told her that the Emperor still\\n\\n\\x0cremembered her and that there was a half chance that the Emperor might live for\\nsome more time if only he could see her once. It was only for that reason that the\\nChief Minister sent his men to capture her and bring her to the Emperor’s\\npresence.\\n\\nPoonkuzhali also told her in sign language that she stayed in the Chief Minister’s\\nPalace for the night. She further told her that Princess Kunthavai was waiting for\\nthe Mute Queen at the Chief Minister’s palace and that she would personally\\ntake her to the Emperor.\\n\\nMandhakini consented to go with them to the Palace. When they reached the\\ngates of the Fort the personal guards of the Emperor, the Velakkara Army, were\\nentering the Fort. Mandhakini and her escorts stepped aside to let the army pass.\\n\\nMandhakini was looking at the King’s Bodyguards with great curiosity. A big\\ncrowd barged into the Fort along with the army of body guards. The soldiers\\nguarding the gates did their best to prevent the entry of those people; but failed.\\nThe soldiers even tried to close the gates of the Fort. But they could not do it.\\nThey could not do anything.\\n\\nAzhwarkkadian told them - “Let us not go with this crowd. There is a secret\\nunderground passage that’ll take us to the Chief Minister’s Palace. Let’s use it.”\\nPoonkuzhali was trying her best to pass on this information to Mandhakini\\nthrough sign language.\\n\\nBut the Mute Queen did not pay heed. She tried to go in along with the crowd.\\nAzhwarkkadian and Poonkuzhali had no option other than to follow her. After\\nentering the Fort, Thirumalai told about the secret passage once again and\\nsuggested that they could use that to avoid the unruly crowd. Poonkuzhali tried\\nto communicate to Mandhakini; but she did not listen. She blended with the\\n\\n\\x0ccrowd. The other two were surprised. The Mute Queen was generally allergic to\\ncrowd. What made her to freely mix with the crowd, they wondered.\\n\\nAfter sometime some people in the crowd started noticing Mandhakini.\\n\\n“Hey, look at this lady! Doesn’t she look like the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur?”\\n\\nPeople started to talk among themselves. Poonkuzhali and Azhwarkkadian were\\nconcerned. They tried to stop her. Some men noticed Azhwarkkadian and started\\nasking - “Who’s this Vaishnavite? Why is he bothering this lady?”\\n\\nSome of the King’s bodyguards heard these words. They came back and\\nsurrounded the Mute Queen. They pushed other people around her. In the melee\\nPoonkuzhali and Azhwarkkadian were pushed away from Mandhakini.\\n\\nOne of the King’s bodyguards spoke to Mandhakini Devi - “Who are you, Devi?\\nIs anyone trying to hurt you? Let us know. We’ll catch culprit and hang him\\nhere.”\\n\\nMandhakini remained silent.\\n\\nOne man saw her and remarked, “Doesn’t she look like the Pazhuvur Queen?”\\n\\n“Yes, she does. Perhaps she is very proud because of that.”\\n\\n\\x0c“The entire Pazhuvur crowd is like this woman. An arrogant lot!”\\n\\nAll these things happened near the palace of Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar. A few\\nPazhuvur soldiers had come there.\\n\\nThey heard the derogatory remark about the Pazhuvur crowd.\\n\\n“Who insulted the Pazhuvur people? Let him dare to come to my presence.”\\n\\nOne of the bodyguards went up to him.\\n\\n“Yes. I am the one. What are you going to do?”\\n\\n“You are arrogant. Your crowd is arrogant. Your pride will be destroyed very\\nsoon. Beware!”\\n\\n“Oh, you are talking like this because you have killed our Prince, right? It’s\\nbecause of such evil elements like you that we are facing devastating storms.\\nLike the one we had yesterday.” - A man in the crowd burst out.\\n\\nThe Pazhuvur soldier sprang on that man. The King’s bodyguard stopped him.\\nPandemonium prevailed for a while.\\n\\n\\x0c“Hail the Great Men of Pazhuvur” one group shouted.\\n\\n“Hail Sundara Chozhan, the Emperor of The Three Worlds “another group\\nshouted.\\n\\n“Hail Kodumbalur Velar.”\\n\\n“Hail Thirukkovalur Malaiyaman.”\\n\\nJust then the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar arrived on a horse. The clashes stopped.\\nPeople scattered in all the directions. The body guards went to the front. The\\nsoldiers of Pazhuvur surrounded the Junior and told him what happened.\\nPoonkuzhali and Azhwarkkadian were on one side of the street. They were\\nlooking for Mandhakini Devi. She was not to be found.\\n\\n“Aiyoo! What is this? Oh My God! How did this happen? What a wonderful\\nGovernment we have! Tell me how are we going to find my aunt? Will she be\\nhurt? Has she been kidnapped by somebody?” - Poonkuzhali was concerned.\\n\\nAs soon as the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar and his soldiers went away they searched\\nfor the mute queen. She was not to be found.\\n\\nAzhwarkkadian suggested - “Let me be here for a while. You run to the Chief\\nMinister’s Palace and tell the Minister and the Princess about the developments.\\nWe two are not enough to search your aunt. The Minister and the Princess will\\n\\n\\x0cmake some arrangements.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali hesitated. Azhwarkkadian spoke again.\\n\\n“Please listen to me. Your aunt is safe. Nothing would have happened to her. I\\nsuspect that she might have seen a known face in the crowd. She was focussing\\nher eyes in one direction. My guess is that she saw somebody known to her.\\nThat’s why she came in along with the crowd. I am sure that she is following\\nhim. We can definitely find her. But first pass on the news to the Chief Minister.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali came running to the Chief Minister’s Palace.\\n\\nKunthavai was concerned; but the Chief Minister was not.\\n\\n“See, Your Highness. The ghost of mutiny is waiting for a chance to pounce\\nupon us. If only the people knew that Arulmozhivarman is alive, the whole\\ncountry will be on fire.”\\n\\n“So long as you are the Chief Minister, that won’t happen! Now let’s talk about\\nmy step mother, Minister Sir. It looks like what I feared might happen. Tell me\\nhow to find her.”\\n\\n“Don’t worry about her, Devi. She has come into the Fort. She can’t go out\\nwithout my knowledge. I’ll make arrangements for that. I’ll also send a search\\nparty to look for her. I am sure Mandhakini Devi will not leave our Fort without\\nseeing the Emperor.”\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 27 - In the Subterranean Treasury\\n\\nIn a way Azhwarkkadian’s guess on the reason for the Mute Queen getting away\\nfrom them was right.\\n\\nA huge crowd barged into the Fort soon after the Emperor’s bodyguards entered.\\nMandhakini saw the conspirator, Ravidasan, entering the Fort along with the\\ncrowd. As a general rule people who are deprived of the use of one sense organ\\nwould have extraordinary sharpness in the other sense organs. Mandhakini could\\nnot talk. Nor could she hear. As if to compensate these losses her eye-sight was\\nunusually sharp. Azhwarkkadian and Poonkuzhali focused their attention only\\non Mandhakini Devi and did not see anybody else. That was the reason\\nMandhakini could see Ravidasan while the other two did not see him.\\n\\nMandhakini Devi had a gift of a strong sense of foreboding. She strongly felt in\\nher nerves that Ravidasan had come into the Fort for an evil mission. She\\nremembered Ravidasan’s attempts to kill Prince Arulmozhivarman in Srilanka.\\nWhen she saw Ravidasan in the streets of Thanjavur her eyes never left him,\\neven for a second.\\n\\nWhen the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar rode into the crowd, in a confused state the\\ncrowd dispersed giving way for him. Precisely at that time Mandhakini saw\\nRavidasan and another person hurrying into one of the alleys inside the Fort. She\\nran behind the two men and soon she was in the same alley with them.\\n\\nA minute after this happened, Azhwarkkadian and Poonkuzhali were pushed\\naway by the crowd and for a few seconds they could not keep track of\\nMandhakini Devi. Later when they looked for her she was not to be found.\\n\\n\\x0cAs soon as Mandhakini entered the alley she turned back a couple of times to\\ncheck whether Poonkuzhali and Azhwarkkadian were following her. She did not\\nsee them. She was clear that her priority now was to follow Ravidasan.\\n\\nLong back when Vandhiya Thevan fled from Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s men he\\ntook exactly the same route now taken by Ravidasan and his accomplice, Soman\\nSambavan, the one who was part of the conspirators’ assembly at the war\\nmemorial at Thiruppurambayam.\\n\\nThe two men ran through the alleys. They did not mind the trees lying on the\\nway. They just jumped over those fallen trees and the small cesspools of stagnant\\nwater. There was a mild breeze which caused the leaves to flutter and the\\nbranches to sway gently. They never suspected that somebody could follow\\nthem. They never looked back. And even if they did, they would not have\\nnoticed Mandhakini Devi who was quite adept in hiding herself from their eyes.\\n\\nTheir fast walk ended near the outer wall of the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s\\npalace. An uprooted tree had fallen over the wall. Ravidasan and Soman\\nSambavan used the tree as a ladder to scale the wall and jump into the palace\\ngarden. Mandhakini Devi was keenly observing their actions. She also took the\\nsame route.\\n\\nRavidasan made Soman Sambavan wait in the garden. He then approached the\\npalace of Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar. Both the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar and his\\nqueen, Nandini, were not in the palace at that time. The place looked deserted.\\nRavidasan could however hear the voices of the maids. Two of the maids came\\nto the back yard. They found that many trees in the garden had fallen down.\\n\\n\\x0c“Our garden now looks like the Asokavan of Ramayana, after it was destroyed\\nby Hanuman.” A maid commented.\\n\\n“You are right. If only our Sita Devi were here now she would have been terribly\\nupset.”\\n\\nThey were chatting for some time and then turned back to go into the Palace.\\nRavidasan, who was well hidden in the bushes, mimicked the hooting sound of\\nan owl. The maids looked in the direction of the sound.\\n\\nOne of the maids said - “Did you hear that? An owl is hooting in the afternoon. I\\nthink even the owls have gone crazy after yesterday’s storm.” The other maid\\nremained silent. The two women then went into the palace.\\n\\nAfter sometime the silent one came back. She reached the gazebo that was\\nsandwiched between the Palace and the underground treasury. It was in this\\ngazebo that Vandhiya Thevan met the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur long back.\\n\\nThe maid looked at the garden with a pointed glance. The owl’s hooting was\\nheard again. The maid walked towards the source of the sound. Ravidasan who\\nhad been hiding behind a large tree came out to meet her. He stared at the maid\\nwith his magnetic eyes.\\n\\n“Oh, Sorcerer, was that you? The Queen is not here. Why did you come now?”\\n\\n“The Queen sent me here.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Oh My God! You didn’t leave the Queen in peace even while she was\\ntravelling. Why did you come? If only somebody knows.... “\\n\\n“So what...”\\n\\n“Don’t be so flippant. The Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar is suspicious of the maids\\nhere in this palace. He has warned me. He has issued strict orders - should you\\never come here I should report to him immediately.”\\n\\n“Let him go to hell. Their period is over. Don’t worry. I want the keys of the\\nunderground treasury. Please bring them fast.”\\n\\n“No. I won’t give them to you.”\\n\\n“See, this is your Queen’s signet ring. I have the required authority.”\\n\\n“You might have stolen it from her, who knows?”\\n\\n“How dare you call me a thief? And you do that even after seeing your Queen\\ntrembling in fear in my presence. I am going to curse you now. Tonight nine\\nghosts will come to your bed and carry you to the burial ground and then..... “\\n\\n“NO! NO! NO! DON’T DO THAT! Let your ghosts be with you. Why should I\\n\\n\\x0cbother about anything? You showed me the Queen’s signet ring and I am\\nfetching you whatever you need. But don’t be in a hurry. See the garden is in\\nruins. And the maids of the palace are coming here often to have a look. I’ll\\nbring the keys to you when the girls are eating their dinner. And be patient till\\nthen.”\\n\\n“Agreed. Please bring some food for me as well. It has been two days since I ate.\\nSo bring me plenty of food.”\\n\\nThe maid left the place.\\n\\nRavidasan and Soman Sambavan sat on a fallen tree and were chatting for a long\\ntime. Mandhakini Devi was keenly observing their actions. She hid herself from\\ntheir view and sat a little away from them. She could not understand the\\nconversation between Ravidasan and the maid. But her intuition warned her that\\nsomething bad was going to happen quite soon.\\n\\nThe maid returned after a long time. Ravidasan went to her. He got the keybunch and the food parcel from her.\\n\\nRavidasan and the girl went to the gazebo and from there they started walking\\ntowards the subterranean treasury. The treasury-lock had to be opened with three\\ndifferent keys. The place was absolutely dark.\\n\\nRavidasan turned to the maid.\\n\\n\\x0c“Oh My God! I forgot! How can I go in this darkness? Can you bring a light or\\nat least a torch?”\\n\\n“How can I bring the light or torch at noon? If somebody sees me and suspects\\nmy intentions… “\\n\\n“I don’t know. But do you want me to believe that you are not smart enough to\\nsmuggle a light here? If you don’t I’ll send fire-mouthed ghosts to devour you...\\n“\\n\\n“Will you please shut up? You want a light? I’ll bring it.”\\n\\n“And before you do that I’ll have my food. I am famished.”\\n\\nAs soon as the maid left for the palace Ravidasan went into the garden along\\nwith the food parcel. He gave it to his accomplice Soman Sambavan.\\n\\n“You might have to stay in the Treasury for two or three days. You may have to\\nwait for the right opportunity. Have this food parcel with you. The girl has gone\\nto fetch a light. You need to go into the treasury before she comes back.”\\n\\nThe two men walked towards the treasury. Mandhakini Devi was in hot pursuit.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 28 - The Subterranean Chamber\\n\\nRavidasan carefully looked in all the directions. He then pointed out the open\\ndoor that led to the subterranean chamber to Soman Sambavan. He asked him to\\ngo in.\\n\\n“At first you won’t be able to see. It’ll be so dark down there. But don’t stand\\nnear the door. Go a little further and stand there till you get used to that\\ndarkness.”\\n\\nNo sooner than Soman Sambavan entered the underground passage he was\\nswallowed by the darkness. Ravidasan then walked through the garden path to\\nreach Nandini Devi’s gazebo. He was viewing the Pazhuvettaraiyar’s palace\\nfrom there. There was a reason. If somebody other than the maid came out he\\nwould have to run back to the underground chamber and close the door.\\n\\nWhile Ravidasan was in the gazebo Mandhakini walked towards the\\nunderground chamber without making any noise. The door was still open. She\\ngot in.\\n\\nMandhakini was used to staying in dense forests during night time. The\\nsubterranean darkness did not deter her. She was able to regain her vision in a\\nfew seconds. She saw Ravidasan’s companion hitting a pillar in the passage. She\\nwalked in the opposite direction. She found a flight of steps leading further\\ndown. She walked down the steps and stood there.\\n\\nSoman Sambavan must have heard some ruffling noise.\\n\\n\\x0c“Who is that? Who is that? - He shouted.\\n\\nHis voice went through the open door and reached the ears of Ravidasan. At the\\nsame time Ravidasan saw the maid walking to him with a burning torch in hand.\\nHe ran ahead and cautioned his accomplice. As soon as he entered the passage\\nhe spoke out aloud “Sambava, where are you? Did you call me?”\\n\\n“Yes, I did.”\\n\\n“Why are you in a hurry? If only somebody outside heard you we’d be finished.\\nDid you think that I’d leave you alone here and go away?”\\n\\n“No, not at all. I wanted to ask you something.”\\n\\nSoman Sambavan approached Ravidasan.\\n\\nAt this time there was a bright light near the door.\\n\\n“Oh, the maid has come back with a torch. She should not see you at any cost.\\nGo! Go deep inside and hide yourself behind one of the pillars. Quick!”\\n\\nSoman Sambavan retreated in a hurry.\\n\\n\\x0cThe next second the maid was there at the door along with the burning torch.\\n\\n“Sorcerer, Sorcerer, where are you?”\\n\\n“Right here.”\\n\\nRavidasan approached her and got the torch from her.\\n\\n“Hi girl, lock the door from outside and take back the keys. Come back with the\\nkeys after thirty minutes. Knock the door gently. If I respond to your knocking\\nthen and only then open the door. Make sure nobody is around when you open\\nthe door.”\\n\\n“Done, Sorcerer. But it is my duty to warn you. Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar has\\nalready smelt something fishy. If you are caught by any chance, promise me that\\nyou won’t spill my name.”\\n\\n“Don’t worry, girl. Didn’t I tell you that the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s time is up?\\nHe is in his last days.”\\n\\n“Why do you want me to come again to open the door? Don’t you know about\\nthe other exit?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Yes, I do. But that exit will be useless today. Vettaru River is in floods. Ok, you\\nmay go now. And come back exactly after 24 minutes.”\\n\\nThe maid went out.\\n\\nThe moment she locked the door from outside Ravidasan locked the door from\\ninside. He then held the torch aloft and went to Soman Sambavan.\\n\\n“Sambava, you wanted to ask me something?”\\n\\n“Did you come here earlier?”\\n\\n“I have come here so many times. Whatever gold and treasures we have now\\ncame only from here.”\\n\\n“I didn’t ask that. You left me here and went out. Did you come in again?”\\n\\n“No. I came just now.”\\n\\n“Only now? You didn’t come earlier?”\\n\\n“No, I didn’t. Why do you ask?”\\n\\n\\x0c“After you went out something blocked the light at the door. I hit a pillar.”\\n\\n“Perhaps the door might have closed and opened again.”\\n\\n“It seemed as though a figure walked in. I remember hearing the footsteps.”\\n\\n“You are hallucinating, Sambava. This underground chamber is like that. At\\ntimes there will be shadows in darkness. There will be a sudden flash of light\\nwhich will vanish the very next second. You’ll hear weird sounds. Many people\\nwho have come here have died of fear. Their skeletons are scattered around here.\\nPazhuvettaraiyar has deliberately left the bones here so that anybody who enters\\nthe underground treasury by stealth will be scared to death.”\\n\\n“But is it at all possible to come here by stealth?”\\n\\n“Normally, no. I don’t think anybody but me has come here in that way. Even I\\nhave come here thanks to the Junior Queen and her maid.”\\n\\n“But then you were talking about the bones and skeletons?”\\n\\n“If Pazhuvettaraiyar wants to punish anyone he would keep the doors to the\\ntreasury slightly open and let the person hover around the area. If the person is\\ntempted by his greed to come in, well, that’s his end. He’d never go back alive.\\nEven his bones will not go out of this place.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Are you suggesting that but for you no one else who has entered this place by\\nstealth has gone out alive?”\\n\\n“Earlier I was quite sure of that. But now I have my doubts. Especially about\\ntwo persons.”\\n\\n“I know who you are referring to. Vandhiya Thevan and Kandhanmaran. Right?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“We should have killed these people. Why are we still letting them live?”\\n\\n“How many times should I have to tell you? The Junior Queen has spared\\nVandhiya Thevan for a very important task. When Sundara Chozhan’s clan is\\ndestroyed completely Vandhiya Thevan will also die. The time has come. “\\n\\n““\\n\\n“Come; let me show you the secret passages around here. You will have to be\\ncareful about one thing. There is a Mandapam here which contains all the\\nprecious stones and gems. These were collected by the Chozha Kings over\\nhundreds of years and are now lying in heaps. They are priceless. If you are\\ntempted by them you’ll forget your mission.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Ravidasa, do you know who are you talking to? I have also sworn on the\\nheadless body of our King Veerapandiyan as you did.”\\n\\n“Who denied that? When I saw those heaps of priceless gems and pearls, I too\\nwas a little distracted. That’s why I am warning you. Come let’s go. First I’ll\\nshow you the way to the King’s Palace from here. You go around the place and\\nfamiliarize yourself with the surroundings after I leave. It might come handy\\nsome day.”\\n\\nRavidasan held the torch aloft and walked ahead. Soman Sambavan walked\\nalong.\\n\\nThey went on the same way which the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar and Nandini had\\nused some time ago. In the smoky illumination provided by the burning torch the\\npillars and their shadows appeared like large black ghosts. The bats that lived in\\nthat darkness seemed like little spirits let loose. There were huge spider-webs in\\nmany places occupied by giant spiders. On the ground there were many strange\\ncreatures that crawled - some fast and some pretty slow. As Ravidasan had\\npredicted they could hear many weird sounds. The storm raging outside echoed\\ninside the subterranean chambers.\\n\\nSoman Sambavan froze.\\n\\n“Ravidasa, do you hear the sound of footsteps?”\\n\\n“Why not? I do hear the sound of our footsteps. Now is the time to be fearless.\\nDon’t get scared by the sounds and sights. You are shivering in fear even while I\\nam here with you. How are you going to be here all alone for two, three days?”\\n\\n\\x0c“No, I am not afraid. Instead of indulging in pointless hallucination after you\\nhave gone, I want to clarify certain things with you. Didn’t you say that those\\nwho entered this chamber died here?”\\n\\n“Yes, I did. And their ghosts would be hovering around here. So what? The\\nghosts will be scared of us. That little boy, Vandhiya Thevan, had been here and\\nhe escaped from this place unhurt. You and I have seen a million ghosts. Why\\nshould we be afraid?”\\n\\n“I am not worried about the spirits and ghosts. I am worried about the other\\ncreatures... the venomous ones... snakes... scorpions... and others... “\\n\\n“Are you saying that you are afraid of snakes and scorpions? The moment they\\nsee us they’ll run to their holes.”\\n\\n“Even then to stay here for two, three days... I am a little worried, Ravidasa. If I\\nget an opportunity a little earlier... “\\n\\n“No, No. Don’t do that. Never ever commit that blunder. Today is Tuesday.\\nYou’ll have to wait for Wednesday and Thursday. And during these two days\\nfind out the time when Sundara Chozhan is alone. His Queen will always be by\\nhis side. She will go to Durga Parameswari Temple on Friday. You’ll have to\\nfinish your work on Friday night. Sundara Chozhan’s clan will be destroyed\\nwithout a trace on Friday. Any change in the plan might spoil our mission and\\nendanger our lives too.”\\n\\n\\x0cThe men continued to walk fast. Soman Sambavan was a bit restless. He was\\nlooking around as he walked. But the two men could not see Mandhakini who\\nwas following them closely, hiding behind the pillars at times and silently\\nleaping forward at times to ensure that they were in her sight.\\n\\nThey reached the other side of the subterranean chamber. There was a high wall\\nbefore them. There were no windows, doors or other entrances through the wall.\\nBut at the top of the wall there was a small latticed window through which some\\nlight entered the chamber.\\n\\nRavidasan gave the torch to Sambavan. He started scaling the high-rise wall\\nholding on to the crevices and protrusions. He reached the latticed window and\\nspent some time seeing through it. Then he scaled down the wall.\\n\\n“Do you want me to jump out through that latticed window? Is that the only way\\nto reach the target?”\\n\\n“No, not at all. Only rats can get through that aperture. But if you see through\\nthat window you’ll have a glimpse of the Chozha King’s Palace. And you can\\nalso see the most important place in the Palace.”\\n\\n“You mean Sundara Chozhan’s bedroom?”\\n\\n“Yes. You can watch the people’s moments there through this latticed window.\\nNow come with me. And observe what I do.”\\n\\n\\x0cRavidasan bent down his head to examine something on the floor. He placed his\\nfoot on a round stone pressing it hard and while remaining in that position he\\ngripped a square-shaped stone with both his hands and pushed it hard. A passage\\nappeared below.\\n\\n“Oh My God! A secret passage within the underground chamber!”\\n\\n“You are right. No one else but the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar and his Junior Queen\\nknow about this passage. I am the third person to know. You are the fourth. Did\\nyou see how I opened the entrance?”\\n\\nSambavan nodded.\\n\\nThe two men went down through that secret passage. The light from the torch\\ndisappeared.\\n\\nThe Mute Queen came out of her hiding place and in one giant leap reached the\\nentrance of the secret passage. She looked at the passage for some time. She\\nplaced her foot down to get in. At the last minute she changed her mind.\\n\\nShe thought for a while. She then looked at the place where Ravidasan scaled the\\nhigh wall. She leapt to that place and scaled the wall in the same way Ravidasan\\ndid. She reached the latticed window and sat on the place near it. She looked\\nthrough the window.\\n\\nThere was a garden adjacent to the wall. And beyond the garden was a beautiful\\n\\n\\x0cmansion. She had goose bumps when she saw the magnificent building. Her\\nintuition told her that somebody dearer to her than her own life lived there. She\\nalso understood that the culprits using the secret passage had the motive of\\nhurting her dear one. She prayed to that Being of Love residing inside the depths\\nof her heart that she should be blessed with the skill and strength to foil the\\nattempts of those bloody villains.\\n\\nAs she was about to get down from that vantage point she looked at the balcony\\nof the beautiful mansion. She was shocked by what she saw there.\\n\\nRavidasan and Soman Sambavan were in the balcony hiding behind the pillars.\\nIt was daytime and hence she could see the balcony clearly. Ravidasan no longer\\nheld the torch. Sambavan was armed with a deadly spear. Ravidasan got the\\nspear from him and aimed at a spot inside the mansion. Mandhakini’s heart\\nskipped a beat. Thank God, he did not throw the spear. He just mimicked the\\naction. Then he returned the spear to Sambavan. The two men disappeared from\\nthat place.\\n\\nMandhakini climbed down the wall. She hid herself never taking her eyes off the\\nentrance to the secret passage. A little later she could see the light of the torch\\nfrom there. The two men came out and closed the secret passage.\\n\\n“Do you know how to open the entrance?”\\n\\n“Yes, I do. Don’t worry. I’ll honour my commitment. Sundara Chozhan’s life\\nwill be over by this Friday. You complete your part of the mission.”\\n\\n“The Junior Queen will take care of Karikalan. We need not have to worry about\\n\\n\\x0chim. The little tiger has escaped from the sea and looks like it’s in Nagapattinam.\\nBut this time he can’t escape. The two women devils that saved him are right\\nnow in Thanjavur. I saw the boat-girl and the dumb bitch in the crowd that\\nbarged into the Fort. That Vaishnava Fanatic is also here. So there is nobody to\\nsave that little tiger, I mean Prince Arulmozhivarman. I am sending an assassin\\nto Nagapattinam. By this Friday the entire clan of Sundara Chozhan will be\\ndestroyed.”\\n\\n“What about Madhuranthakan?”\\n\\n“Poor fellow! Let him live for some time. It is better that a fool like him\\noccupies the Chozha throne till our Emperor comes of age.”\\n\\nRavidasan and Soman Sambavan traced back their steps to the entrance of the\\nsubterranean chamber.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 29 - The King’s Dharshan\\n\\nAfter the two conspirators disappeared, Mandhakini came to the entrance of\\nsecret passage. She carefully observed the spot. She then made an attempt to\\nopen the secret door but could not. When Ravidasan opened the door she was\\ntoo far from him to notice how he opened the door. She knew in her guts that at\\nleast one of the men would return to that spot sooner or later. So she decided to\\nwait there.\\n\\nShe was not disappointed, for Soman Sambavan returned to that spot after seeing\\noff Ravidasan. He had a torch in his hand. But the light was very faint now.\\nSoman Sambavan was bragging about his courage in the presence of Ravidasan.\\nLeft alone his heart was gripped by a vague fear which was quite evident in the\\nway he looked around.\\n\\nHe sat near the entrance to the secret passage. He was scared. After a few\\nminutes the torch went off. He then started to glance at the latticed window\\nwhich was the only source of light. The light coming through the window was\\ngradually getting weaker and weaker. Once he was sure that the light had\\ncompletely gone and that the sun had set for the day, he tried to open the door to\\nthe secret passage.\\n\\nMandhakini was now standing very close to Soman Sambavan. He had pressed\\nthe right levers and the door opened. He was about to get in.\\n\\nIt was precisely at that time that he heard a long scream very close by. Soman\\nSambavan had witnessed many scary sights in his life. He had heard many\\nstrange sounds. But never in the past had he heard such a strange voice, which\\n\\n\\x0che was sure, did not belong to any living human being. If at all there was\\nsomething called a ghost and if at all it had a voice it would be exactly like the\\nsound he heard just now. When he heard that strange sound for the first time he\\nhesitated. He waited for the echo to fade completely. But when he heard the\\nsame sound for the second time, the hairs on his body stood straight. When he\\nheard the same sound for the third time, his courage evaporated and all his\\nstrength vanished. He was in the grip of fear and started to run blindly in that\\ndark chamber.\\n\\nAs soon as he disappeared, Mandhakini stepped into that secret passage. After a\\nfew steps down she hit level ground. She walked so fast that even if Soman\\nSambavan had seen her getting in and came running behind her he could not\\nhave caught her. For a moment it appeared that the way led to hell; for it was\\ndark and endless. Finally the path did end at one point in front of a high rise\\nwall. She could see a gap on the top. She could feel the presence of steps with\\nher hand. As she tried to climb those steps something hit her head. Between the\\nsteps of the secret passage and the place which hit her head there were some\\nopenings large enough to let her in. She entered one of them and came out on the\\nother side. She could see gigantic figures in the place. Mandhakini was familiar\\nwith the giant-sized statues in the Lankan Island. So she was not shocked by\\nwhat she saw. She carefully noted down the place where the path ended.\\n\\nThere were many giant-sized statues there. The ten-headed demon king Ravana\\nwas trying to uproot Kailash Mountain, the abode of Lord Shiva and Goddess\\nParvathi. The divine couple was seated atop the hill. The place where Ravana\\nhad lifted the hill had become a valley. His twenty hands bore the weight of the\\nmountain.\\n\\nMandhakini saw through the gap between the two hands of the Demon King.\\nShe now knew that she had entered the Hall of Sculptures of the Chozha Palace.\\nNobody would have noticed that there was a path beneath the huge statue of\\nKailash Hill. Nobody would have thought of exploring that path. It was a perfect\\nhiding place.\\n\\n\\x0cMandhakini spent a few hours marvelling at the secret passage that was hidden\\nbeneath a statue in the Hall of Sculptures. Then she went around the hall. There\\nwas not much light there. But because Mandhakini was used to moving in forests\\nin dim light she could see everything very clearly.\\n\\nAt one place there was a statue depicting the Chozha Emperor Sibi giving a\\npiece of his flesh to save a dove that was being chased by a vulture. Chozhas\\nwere given the epithet Sembian because they were descendants of the great\\nEmperor Sibi. The Mute Queen spent some time looking deeply at the sculpture\\nand then moved away.\\n\\nAnother sculpture showed the perennial Ganges River flowing from the head of\\nLord Shiva. Bhageerathan was standing by the side reverentially folding his\\nhands towards the Lord.\\n\\nThe river first known as Bhageerathi flowed into the mouth of a gigantic Rishi\\nand then flowed out through his ears. A short Rishi was taking water from the\\nGanges in his kettle. That Rishi must be Sage Agasthya. He emptied the contents\\nof his kettle on another mountain. The river that flowed from the kettle got\\nbigger and bigger as it came down. That was River Cauvery.\\n\\nThey must have made arrangements for water to flow when the sculpture was\\noriginally installed there. But there was no water now. River Cauvery became\\nlong, turned at several points and passed through mountains and large gardens\\nfull of dense trees.\\n\\nThere were a lot of temples of Lord Shiva on the either side of the river. At the\\npoint where River Cauvery fell in the sea the Hall of Sculptures ended in a wall.\\n\\n\\x0cMandhakini placed her hand on the wall and pressed. A small door opened. She\\ncame out through the door and landed in the Royal garden. The Palace towers\\nand balconies appeared close by.\\n\\nMandhakini looked around. It was late in the evening. The lights were fading.\\nThere was nobody in the Royal garden. There were many fallen trees in the\\ngarden as there were in Pazhuvettaraiyar’s palace. Even if somebody had been\\nthere in the garden they would not have seen her getting out of the Hall of\\nSculptures.\\n\\nMandhaki stood near the Hall of Sculptures waiting for darkness to set in. There\\nwas a likelihood of that Devil armed with a spear coming at that time. She was\\nlooking into the Hall of Sculptures every now and then.\\n\\nThe lamps in the castle came to life one by one. In a few minutes the palace was\\nbathed in the light of oil lamps. The light from the lamps in the lower chambers\\nescaped the palace buildings through the windows. The lamps in the terrace\\ncompeted with the stars.\\n\\nOh My God! The night looks more dangerous than the day, thought Mandhakini.\\n\\nShe carefully scanned all the directions with her sharp eyes. She discovered that\\nthere were not many lamps in the part of the palace that was adjacent to the Hall\\nof Sculptures. She remembered the place. It was exactly in this place where the\\nvillain who tried to kill her dear one, Ponniyin Selvan, (the one she personally\\nsaved from River Cauvery), had stood a little while ago along with his\\naccomplice. It was in this place that Ravidasan got the spear from the other\\nperson and took an aim as if he were going to throw it on somebody. There were\\nnot many lamps in this area. What could probably be the reason, she thought.\\nBut right now the lack of lamps provided her a cover of darkness.\\n\\n\\x0cAs soon as the sun set completely and the Royal garden was enveloped in a sheet\\nof darkness, Mandhakini ran towards the Palace as fast as a frightened deer. She\\nreached the Palace building in a matter of seconds. That part of the Palace had a\\nlot of round enclosures covered in sloping roofs. The sloping roofs were\\nsupported by an array of pillars. At several places there were steps that led to the\\nupper chambers of the Palace. In those enclosures she could find large copper\\nvessels normally used to cook feasts for a large number of people. There were\\nalso many old ivory palanquins and discarded thrones. Mandhakini glanced at\\nthose objects for a while. Finally Mandhakini got enough courage to climb a\\nflight of stairs. There were round enclosures at the first floor as well. But the\\npillars that supported the roofs in the first floor had a lot of artwork on them. The\\nwindows were artistic too. There were a lot of marble benches on which the\\nmembers of the Royal household probably sat to enjoy the moon-lit nights.\\n\\nMandhakini went around the seemingly deserted rooms and verandas in the\\nterrace. She was afraid to go to the interior portion of the terrace. She saw light\\nat one place. She hid herself behind a pillar and looked on.\\n\\nOH MY GOD!\\n\\nShe saw something from which she could not take off her eyes.\\n\\nIn a large enclosure there was a huge cot which had a lot of art work on it. A\\nperson was lying on the bed. There were four women and two men standing\\naround the man. Mandhakini could infer from her hiding place that the people\\nstanding were devoted to the person lying down. A little away stood two maids\\nwho were even more reverential.\\n\\n\\x0cThere was only one lamp in that enclosure. And that was fixed in a niche near\\nthe bed. The light was faint. Mandhakini saw those standing around the cot. One\\nof them was a person who was dearer to her than her own life - her brother’s\\ndaughter, Poonkuzhali. She had seen others earlier albeit from a distance. But\\nshe did not remember or recognise them now.\\n\\nMandhakini hesitantly moved her eyes to the person lying in the cot. Her heart\\nstopped.\\n\\nYes. He was the one. He was the one who stole her life and her heart when she\\nwas a little girl. But that happened several aeons ago. He was the one whom she\\nhad met in the Ghost Island when she was a little girl roaming around the forest\\nwithout any care in the world. Yes, He was the one who had converted the Ghost\\nIsland into a heaven for some time. Yes, he was the one forcibly taken away from\\nher by those people who came in large numbers in a large ship. Oh My God!\\nHow time has changed him!\\n\\nAll those events happened so long ago that Mandhakini thought they must have\\nhappened in her past life. Yes, she had seen him several times after that, every\\ntime without his knowing about it.\\n\\nWhen he went on the luxury boats in River Cauvery she had hidden herself\\nbehind the bushes and had seen him. When he went on the streets in the golden\\nchariot drawn by pedigree white steeds imported from Arabia she was in the\\ncrowd cheering him. But she had not seen him recently.\\n\\nBut my God! Why has he changed so much in so short a time? Why has he aged\\nso much so fast?\\n\\n\\x0cHe now sported a moustache and a beard. There was no flesh on his cheeks. The\\nskin had gone dry. There were wrinkles on his forehead.\\n\\nOh My God, what happened to the magnetic light which used to glow in his\\nbeautiful eyes? Do men change so much in so short a time? Mandhakini had\\nseen many people in the Lankan Island who were afflicted with the poisonous\\nfever and who were about to die. And this man closely resembled those people.\\n\\nOh My God! His face which used to shine like a golden sun has completely lost\\nits sheen. Perhaps his end is near.\\n\\nMandhakini suddenly remembered the scene that she witnessed a few hours ago.\\nRavidasan and his accomplice were standing at the place where she was standing\\nnow. It was from this place did they take an aim with a spear.\\n\\nOh My God! Did they aim at the person lying in the cot? The mere thought made\\nher body shudder. She was losing her balance. She felt like fainting. She held the\\npillar nearby with all her might to avoid a fall.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 30 - The Charge\\n\\nThe Emperor was in a very bad state. He was shattered –in mind and body.\\nPrince Kunthavai had told the Chief Minister that the Emperor did not have even\\na wink of sleep on the night of the storm. It was not an exaggeration.\\n\\nEven during the day his mind was in a mess.\\n\\nLater in the afternoon the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar came to see him. And his\\nwords only served to aggravate the Emperor’s agony.\\n\\nJunior Pazhuvettaraiyar charged the Chief Minister of several offences. Ever\\nsince the Chief Minister came to the capital the security arrangements at the Fort\\nwere lax.\\n\\nQuite a lot of people now entered the Fort on the pretext of seeing the Chief\\nMinister. This might compromise on the security of even the Emperor, he\\ncautioned. Of course the Emperor brushed these charges with a smile. He did not\\nconsider them worthy of investigation.\\n\\nBut the Emperor could not brush aside the further charges levelled against the\\nChief Minister. The Junior told the King that on that day there was a scuffle\\nbetween the King’s Bodyguards, the Velakkara Army and the people who came\\nfrom outside.\\n\\n\\x0cHe said that heated words were exchanged between the bodyguards and the\\npeople and the situation could have worsened into a civil disturbance.\\n\\nBut fortunately the Junior crossed the place at that time and a major clash was\\naverted. The Junior also said that he talked to both sides and made sure that the\\nwarring factions went away in peace.\\n\\nThe next charge against the Chief Minister was graver still. The Chief Minister\\nwas known throughout the country as a man of high morals. But, the Junior\\ncomplained, his conduct during the last few days was not worthy of his name or\\nstature.\\n\\nThe Chief Minister had forcibly abducted a woman from Kodikkarai and had\\nbrought her to the capital. And that he used the palanquin and the men of\\nPazhuvur Palace for the shameful act.\\n\\nThe Junior told the King that he could not refuse a request coming from the\\nChief Minister and that he instantly obliged him with the men and the palanquin\\nfrom the Pazhuvur Palace.\\n\\nAnd now that the Minister had used them for a dishonourable purpose the shame\\nwould be on the Pazhuvur clan, he argued.\\n\\nThe final charge centred on a suspicious occurrence.\\n\\n“I was worried because a Sorcerer was visiting my brother’s palace quite often.\\n\\n\\x0cAs the Sorcerer was coming at the instance of the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur I\\ncould not directly take any action against the suspicious visitor.\\n\\n\"Nevertheless I appointed a spy to keep a watch on the movements near my\\nbrother’s palace. The spy reported to me today that somebody jumped the wall\\nof the Chancellor’s Palace.\\n\\n\"I sent more men to apprehend the trespasser. My men caught the offender. And\\nit turned out to be none other than Azhwarkkadian, the darling disciple of our\\nHonourable Chief Minister.\\n\\n“Why did you scale the wall?” - I asked him. He refused to reply. He also said\\nthat he was acting on the orders of the Chief Minister. If the Chief Minister\\nstoops to this level... well, how can I handle the security of Thanjavur Fort.? “\\n\\n\"As my brother is not in town I had to trouble you with this information.”\\n\\nThe Emperor’s agony worsened.\\n\\n“Leave it to me. Aniruddhar is coming to see me this evening. I’ll ask him to\\nexplain his actions. I am deeply hurt by his act of abducting a woman from\\nKodikkarai. Are you sure it’s true? Have you checked?”\\n\\n“I have absolutely no doubts, Your Majesty. The palanquin bearers and the\\nsoldiers who accompanied them are the direct eye-witnesses to what happened.\\nThey reported everything to me yesterday midnight.\\n\\n\\x0c\"According to their account they were caught in the storm as they were\\napproaching the Thanjavur Fort. A tree had fallen down and it appears some\\nwere crushed by it. They were relieved to find that the tree did not fall on the\\npalanquin.\\n\\n\"Thank God we are not guilty of killing an innocent woman. Your Majesty\\nshould hold an enquiry on this incident. And Your Majesty should also enquire\\nAzhwarkkadian.”\\n\\nThe Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar took leave of the Emperor. He did not want to be\\nthere when the Chief Minister came to see the King. He had his own fears.\\n\\nThe Minister might pose some embarrassing questions to him. More importantly\\nif the Chief Minister got the Emperor’s sanction to open the Royal Treasury for\\nFlood Relief it would be a greater problem. Then he would not be able to face\\nhis brother.\\n\\nThe Emperor was expecting Aniruddha Brahmarayar right from the morning.\\nBut the Minister came only in the evening when the sun was about to set.\\n\\nThe Minister, generally a strong person, appeared shaken that day. Even though\\nhe had planned his actions meticulously to the last detail it had backfired.\\n\\nHe thought he would have some news about Mandhakini and then he could meet\\nthe Emperor.\\n\\n\\x0cThat was the reason he had been postponing the meeting till it was very late.\\nAnd Azhwarkkadian brought more bad news.\\n\\nHe reported that he went to the alley where he suspected the Mute Queen would\\nhave probably gone. And he reported seeing a lady jumping Pazhuvettaraiyar’s\\nwall.\\n\\nAnd he was sure that it was Mandhakini. Before he could look for the lady he\\nwas apprehended by the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s men.\\n\\n“Master, I could not tell the real reason to them. I had to use your name to free\\nmyself.” - Azhwarkkadian said.\\n\\nThis made him even more anxious.\\n\\n“There are so many palaces inside the Fort. Why should she choose the Senior\\nPazhuvettaraiyar’s Palace? I can’t even openly search the place. But let’s see. In\\na way it’s better that the Senior is not in town at the moment.\\n\\n\"I’ll place my men around the Palace. I have my man inside the Palace as well.\\nI’ll send word to him to keep an eye for the lady. But this boat-girl has caused so\\nmuch of embarrassment for me.”\\n\\n“Master, even if the boat-girl had not intervened, there is no guarantee that\\nMandhakini Devi would have acted in the manner you liked. She would have\\n\\n\\x0ctried to run away.”\\n\\n“But I have hopes. Having come thus far she would not go back without seeing\\nthe Emperor. Let’s try, Thirumalai. But it won’t be fair to delay my meeting with\\nthe Emperor any further. I want you and that boat-girl to accompany me.\\n\\n\"We should tell the Emperor whatever we know about the Prince. If the boat-girl\\nwho actually rescued the Prince and rowed him to safety told the story herself\\nthe Emperor will be convinced.”\\n\\nChief Minister Aniruddha Brahmarayar, his disciple Azhwarkkadian and\\nPoonkuzhali walked into the Palace late in the evening.\\n\\nPrincess Kunthavai and Vanathi were waiting for them at the entrance of the\\nPalace. Kunthavai was disturbed by the fact that Mandhakini Devi could not be\\ntraced.\\n\\nShe was even more disturbed on knowing that the Mute Queen had trespassed\\ninto the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s garden. She was worried over the possible\\ndisastrous consequences this may entail.\\n\\n“Minister Sir, I hear that there is an underground exit from the Pazhuvur Palace.\\nWhat if the lady escapes by that route?”\\n\\nThe Minister was reminded of Vandhiya Thevan.\\n\\n\\x0c“Devi, it is not that easy to find out that exit. Not everyone will be as lucky as\\nVandhiya Thevan. But I have not ruled out that possibility. I have placed my men\\noutside the Fort as well.”\\n\\nHe then went into the Emperor’s bed chamber leaving Poonkuzhali and\\nAzhwarkkadian with Kunthavai.\\n\\nThe Minister paid his respects to the Emperor and Queen Vanamaadevi. He then\\nexplained the reasons for his delay. He was busy in assessing the damages\\ncaused by the recent floods and organising relief work.\\n\\nThe Emperor was a little pacified on knowing about the relief work.\\n\\n“It’s good you were here in the absence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\\n\\nBut what is this I hear? Did you forcibly abduct any woman from Kodikkarai?\\nThe Commander of the Fort, Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar told me a little while ago.\\n\\n\"My dear Brahmarayar, I never expected this kind of a conduct from you. There\\nmight be a very strong reason for doing that.\\n\\n\"In that case you should have informed me upfront. Or perhaps you all think that\\nyou need not share any information with me because I am ill, because I am an\\ninvalid lying on my bed all day doing nothing?\\n\\n\\x0c\"Kunthavai tells me that Arulmozhivarman did not drown and that he is safe at\\nthe Buddhist Monastery in Nagapattinam. I don’t know whether I should be\\nhappy or sad. If he is alive why hasn’t he come to see me till now? Why nobody\\nhas told me that he is alive till now?\\n\\n\"Minister, I am afraid that so many things are happening around me and I am\\nkept in the dark. So many things are happening in my kingdom. I am wondering\\nwhy I should continue to live......”\\n\\nThe Emperor choked. There were tears in his eyes.\\n\\nThe Chief Minister maintained silence because he did not want to interrupt the\\nEmperor.\\n\\nHe broke his silence with forceful words.\\n\\n“Stop it, My Lord. Please stop talking like this. We have been friends for forty\\nyears, my Lord. And during these forty years I have not done anything against\\nyour interests. And I won’t do in future as well.\\n\\n\"Yes, I kept a few matters to myself with the good intention of not disturbing\\nyou when you are ill. That was out of my love and respect for you.\\n\\n\"If you think I have wronged you, please forgive me, Your Majesty. And now I’ll\\nanswer all your questions.\\n\\n\\x0cI request you to please listen to me.”\\n\\n“Chief Minister, I don’t think I’ll be peaceful in this birth. I am not sure whether\\nI’d get that eluding peace in my next birth too. When my children and my\\ndearest friend and Chief Minister are engaged in a conspiracy against me.... “\\n\\n“My Lord, you’ll soon know who are conspiring against you. I am not part of\\nthat conspiracy gang. I am retaining the Minister post only in name. I have told\\nyou several times that I’ll hand over the Minister post to the Senior\\nPazhuvettaraiyar. Even now I am ready, Your Majesty. I’ll give my post to him\\nand walk out empty handed even if you have the slightest doubt on my loyalty…\\n“\\n\\n“Yes, Minister. You are always ready to desert me at the slightest provocation.\\nThe only person who is going to be with me till I breathe my last is this woman,\\nmy wife, the Malaiyaman’s daughter.\\n\\n\"I have committed a lot of sins; but I must have done some good deeds on the\\nside. For otherwise, I would not have got this angel as my wife in this life.”\\n\\nVanamaadevi heard these words and broke into a sob. She then ran out of the\\nroom.\\n\\n“Oh, King of Kings, whatever you said about your wife is true. And your\\nchildren born of her divine womb are all fiercely devoted to you.”\\n\\n\\x0c“But they don’t respect my words, Minister. They don’t obey my orders. They\\ndo whatever they like to do. And you are always on their side.\\n\\n\"You knew from the beginning that Arulmozhivarman is alive and that he is in\\nthe Buddhist Monastery at Nagapattinam. Why didn’t you tell me earlier?”\\n\\n“Please forgive me, My Lord. I was not sure of that till yesterday. I was sure of\\none thing though - that the Prince would be blessed with long life. The\\nastrologers were quite unanimous when they cast the Prince’s horoscope at the\\ntime of his birth - that he’d live long and attain glorious heights in life. I never\\nthought that those predictions would become false.”\\n\\n“Chief Minister, there is no limit to the havoc wrought by astrology and\\nastrologers. I am thinking of sending all the astrologers into exile.\\n\\n\"Some people have placed a heavy reliance on the astrological predictions\\nconcerning Arulmozhi and want to crown him as the King even while I am alive.\\nAren’t you one of them, Minister?”\\n\\n“I promise I am not, my Lord. On the other hand I thought that it would be better\\nif the Prince doesn’t enter the Kingdom for some time. When I went to Srilanka I\\ntold my views to the Prince himself.\\n\\n\"As soon as I left Lanka, Pazhuvettaraiyar’s men came to Lanka to apprehend\\nthe Prince. And Your Majesty, it has happened with your full blessings.\\n\\n\\x0c\"This news has spread throughout the country. And the people are quite furious\\nwith the Pazhuvettaraiyars. In fact the rumour is that that the Pazhuvettaraiyars\\nsunk the Prince’s ship and drowned him in the sea.”\\n\\n“Lie, Minister. It’s absolute falsehood. Parthibendran has told everything to me.\\nThe Prince did not come in the ship sent by the Pazhuvettaraiyar brothers.\\n\\n\"He came in Parthibendran’s ship. And the Prince, of his own accord, wantonly\\njumped into the sea. And he did that to save somebody else from another\\nburning ship. And he jumped in spite of Parthibendran strongly advising against\\nthat rash act.\\n\\n\"Now when I think of it I know everything is a lie. And they were all fabricated\\nmainly to deceive me. When I think that Princess Kunthavai too is a part of this\\nconspiracy....\\n\\n\"I couldn’t bear that, Minister. I never could bear that kind of a treachery from\\nmy darling daughter, who is dearer to me than my own life.\\n\\nEven if the whole world goes against me I thought Kunthavai would be on my\\nside. And I shared with her something which no father would share with his\\ndaughter.”\\n\\n“Oh, King of Kings, even if the whole world accuses Kunthavai of conspiring\\nagainst you, I won’t believe that. You shouldn’t believe that either. If the\\nPrincess holds back something from you then she should have a strong reason\\nfor that.\\n\\n\\x0c\"It’s a fact that the Prince jumped in the sea to save his friend. The boat-girl who\\nrescued both the Prince and his friend and then rowed them to the shore is\\nwaiting in the ante-room. She was an eye-witness to what happened in Srilanka.\\nShall I call her, Your Majesty?”\\n\\n“Oh! Call her right now, Chief Minister. Was she the one you abducted from\\nKodikkarai?”\\n\\n“Yes, My Lord. I’ll call her now.”\\n\\nThe Chief Minister clapped his hands.\\n\\nAzhwarkkadian and Poonkuzhali entered the Emperor’s bed chamber.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 31 - The Evening Dream\\n\\nThe Emperor looked pointedly at Poonkuzhali.\\n\\n“I don’t think I have seen this girl earlier. But her face looks very familiar.\\nBrahmarayar, who’s she?”\\n\\n“She is Poonkuzhali, daughter of Thiagavidangar of Kodikkarai.”\\n\\n“Oh, now I understand.”\\n\\nAnd then spoke in a whisper to himself. ‘Yes, she resembles her aunt. She\\nreminds me of her. But there are a lot of differences.’\\n\\nPoonkuzhali heard the words spoken by the Emperor, even those he whispered to\\nhimself. She had not seen him so far. She had heard that the Emperor was more\\nhandsome than even the God of Love. The person who had begotten such a\\nhandsome Prince had to be like that, thought Poonkuzhali. But what was she\\nseeing today? She saw the Emperor’s form - the one which was laid waste by\\ndisease and stress inherent in a King’s life. She was shocked. She had come there\\nto fight with the Emperor. Now she was ashamed that she entertained hostile\\nthoughts towards this shattered old man. Fear, a sense of awe and above all a\\nsense of shyness overwhelmed her so much that she forgot to pay her respects to\\nthe monarch.\\n\\n\\x0c“Hey Girl, how is your father, Thiagavidangar? Is he doing fine?”\\n\\nThe Emperor affectionately enquired.\\n\\nPoonkuzhali was jolted to the present. She then remembered that she was\\nstanding in the presence of an Emperor who was wielding sovereignty over a\\nvast area that extended from Srilanka in the South to River Krishna in the North.\\nShe prostrated before Sundara Chozhan. She stood up and folded her hands\\nreverentially towards him.\\n\\nMeanwhile the Emperor voiced his doubts to the Chief Minister.\\n\\n“Can this girl talk? Or is she also dumb like her aunt?”\\n\\nThe King’s face shrunk in unbearable agony when he posed the question\\n\\n“She can talk, Your Majesty. She can talk what nine women can talk at a time.\\nShe is still reeling under the shock of seeing you in person.”\\n\\n“I don’t know why everybody becomes silent on seeing me. Nobody shares\\nanything with me these days.”\\n\\nThe Emperor turned his attention to Poonkuzhali again.\\n\\n\\x0c“Girl, The Chief Minister tells me that you saved Prince Arulmozhivarman from\\ndrowning. Is it true?”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali hesitated and spoke in a barely audible whisper.\\n\\n“Yes, my Lord. If it is.... an offence..... .”\\n\\nThe Emperor laughed. Given his condition the laugh sounded quite hysterical.\\n\\n“Brahmarayar, did you hear her? ‘If it is an offence... ’ She has saved the Prince\\nand says, ‘if it is an offence... ’ Looks like I want to see my son drowned.\\nSomebody has told this girl that I am such a heartless demon. Chief Minister, do\\nthe people of this country think of me in the same way?”\\n\\n“My Lord, please ignore her words. She is in the grip of fear. Hey Girl, the\\nwhole Chozha country is indebted to you for saving the Prince. The Emperor is\\npleased beyond words. You can name your reward and get that from us at the\\nright time. Now tell the Emperor what happened on that eventful day. You need\\nnot have any fear in your mind.”\\n\\n“Let this girl tell this first. She says that she saved the Prince from the sea. But\\nhow did she know that it was the Prince? Has she seen him earlier?” - The\\nEmperor asked.\\n\\n“Yes, my Lord. I have seen the Prince when he boarded the ship to Lanka along\\nwith the army. Once the Prince called me “Samudra Kumari””\\n\\n\\x0c“Aha! The girl has regained her powers of speech!” - The Emperor was\\nsarcastic.\\n\\nThen on being questioned by the Chief Minister Poonkuzhali recounted\\neverything from the time she took Vandhiya Thevan in her boat to Srilanka till\\nshe dropped the Prince at Nagapattinam. But the Chief Minister had already\\nwarned her not to breathe anything about Mandhakini.\\n\\nThe Emperor was pleased.\\n\\n“Girl, what you have done to this country and the Chozha clan is quite\\ninvaluable. I am afraid I cannot compensate you enough for your efforts. But I\\nhave a question. You rescued the Prince and brought him to our shores. Then\\nwhy didn’t you bring him here? Why did you take him to Nagapattinam?”\\n\\n“My Lord, the Prince had a terrible fever. He was delirious. We knew that there\\nare good doctors at the Buddhist Monastery at Nagapattinam. Hence we took\\nhim there. We also knew that the monks there worship the Prince. Again given\\nthe Prince’s condition at that time, he could travel only by boat and not on a\\nhorse-back or a chariot. That way Nagapattinam was the ideal destination.”\\n\\n“Didn’t you know that Pazhuvettaraiyar was camping at Kodikkarai at that time?\\nWhy didn’t you tell him?”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali hesitated only for a fraction of a second. Then she replied in a\\nfearless voice.\\n\\n\\x0c“Your Majesty, the whole country knows that Pazhuvettaraiyar has been working\\nagainst the interests of the Prince. How can I entrust a sick Prince to his avowed\\nenemy?”\\n\\n“You are right. Pazhuvettaraiyars are my sons’ enemies. Not only them, even I\\nam their enemy. That’s how the whole world thinks. Chief Minister, the storm\\nwe had here yesterday night should have been even more severe in the coastal\\ntown of Nagapattinam. I am afraid that the Prince might be in danger.”\\n\\n“My Lord, ours is a blessed country. And we are in the best of our times.\\nHence... “\\n\\n“Yes, the Chozha Kingdom is blessed. But I am cursed. Chief Minister, I want to\\nsee my sons at least once before I die.”\\n\\n“Please don’t utter such words, Your Majesty. Who else in this word is blessed\\nthe way you are? You are blessed with good children, my Lord. I’ll send my men\\nto Nagapattinam to bring back the Prince safely to the Capital. I will also send\\nmy disciple Thirumalai for the purpose.”\\n\\nOnly then did the Emperor cast his glance on Azhwarkkadian.\\n\\n“Oh, he too is here! The Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar was complaining about him.\\nDidn’t he jump the wall of the Pazhuvur Palace?”\\n\\n\\x0c“He has a good reason, my Lord. Permit me to explain everything tomorrow.\\nYou are already exhausted, Your Majesty.”\\n\\nThe Empress, Princess Kunthavai and Vanathi entered the chamber at that time.\\n\\nThe Empress spoke to the Chief Minister.\\n\\n“Minister, let’s stop with this for the day. The Doctors are particular that the\\nEmperor should not strain himself.”\\n\\nThe Queen knew what the Emperor needed at that moment. She spoke to the\\nChief Minister again.\\n\\n“I hear that this girl has a beautiful voice. Ask her to sing a song from Thevaram.\\nThe Emperor loves music.”\\n\\n“As you please, Devi. I’ll also ask my disciple to sing some composition of\\nAzhwars. He too sings very well, Devi.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali sang a composition by Saint Thirunavukkarasar.\\n\\nOnce the Saint was suffering from a killer disease. He was passionately pleading\\nto the Lord, ‘You haven’t removed this disease yet, my Lord. And the disease is\\nlike the Lord of Death constantly tormenting me.’\\n\\n\\x0cThen Azhwarkkadian sang a pasuram from the Azhwars. One of the Azhwars,\\non having a vision of the Lord, tells in that song how he saw the Lord’s consort,\\nthe Holy Mother, then the Lord’s golden form and goes on to describe his\\nglorious vision.\\n\\nThe Emperor closed his eyes as soon as the singing started. Minutes later his\\ntroubled face glowed in peace. His breathing was now soft and regular. It was\\nclear that the Emperor had lapsed into a deep sleep.\\n\\nThe lights were fading outside. A maid lit a lamp inside the chamber. Everybody\\nleft the room. The Empress lingered for a while looking at the sleeping form of\\nthe Emperor.\\n\\nPrincess Kunthavai who was in the adjacent room signalled to her mother. The\\nQueen walked out of the room. But for the rhythmic breathing coming from the\\nEmperor the room was absolutely silent.\\n\\nThe Emperor had not slept the previous night. The songs sung by Poonkuzhali\\nand Azhwarkkadian were quite soothing to his distressed mind. That made the\\nsick Emperor to fall asleep. But his was not a deep sleep. Old memories, new\\nmemories, real life incidents and imagined incidents manifested as dreams.\\n\\nThe Emperor was on the boat with Poonkuzhali as his companion. Poonkuzhali\\nwas singing in tune with the majestic sound coming from the deep sea.\\n\\nOh mind, don’t lose hopes\\n\\n\\x0cYour dreams will come true one day\\nA long, dark, stormy night\\nIs followed by a bright day\\nThe world comes to life\\nThe lotus shivers in happiness\\nThe beetles are ecstatic\\nAnd the sun rises in the East.\\n\\nSundara Chozhan was ecstatic on hearing this song. All his tiredness was gone.\\nHe was happy and refreshed.\\n\\nHe was urging Poonkuzhali to sing more. The boat was floating steadily in the\\ndeep sea.\\n\\nSuddenly a cloud of darkness enveloped them. There were strong winds. There\\nwere waves which resembled moving mountains. The boat which was gently\\nrocking like a cradle now touched the skies one moment and fell down to the\\ndepths of the ocean, the very next. The sails of the boat were shattered by the\\nwinds. Somehow the boat managed to stay afloat. The Emperor was awe-struck\\nby the way Poonkuzhali managed to steer the boat during the storm.\\n\\nSuddenly the winds stopped. The sea calmed down. The waves died down.\\nThere were signs of sun-rise in the Eastern horizon.\\n\\nSoon the sun rose like a golden ball of fire. The sea shone like liquid gold in the\\n\\n\\x0crays of the morning sun.\\n\\nThere were islands full of green coconut groves at a distance. The birds in those\\nislands sang in a sweet voice. The Emperor knew that those islands were near\\nthe Lankan shores. It was in one of those islands that he met Mandhakini in one\\nof his past births.\\n\\nThe Emperor spoke to Poonkuzhali without taking his eyes off those beautiful\\nislands -\\n\\n“Poonkuzhali at last you’ve taken me to heaven. How am I going to thank you,\\ndear?”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali did not respond.\\n\\nThe Emperor looked at her again. He was stunned. Because it was not\\nPoonkuzhali. It was his dear Mandhakini. Mandhakini had not changed during\\nthe past thirty years.\\n\\nThe Emperor did not know what to do. Then he gathered courage to talk to his\\nlady love.\\n\\n“Mandhakini, is that you? Is that really you? Did you come in the form of\\nPoonkuzhali to take me here?”\\n\\n\\x0cThen he remembered that Mandhakini could not hear him. He looked at her face.\\nShe must have understood him by watching his lip moments. There was a smile\\non her face.\\n\\nThe Emperor tried to stand up to go near his lady love. But he could not get up.\\nOnly then he remembered that his legs had become useless long ago.\\n\\n“Mandhakini, I’ve become sick. I can’t come to you. You should come to me.\\nListen, Mandhakini. Even If somebody comes here with an offer to make me the\\nKing of the Three Worlds, I won’t leave you. I’d ask them to go to hell. Let’s not\\ngo to these islands near Lanka. Somebody will be disturbing us there every now\\nand then. Steer the boat away from these islands. Let’s cross the seven seas and\\nreach the island at the end of the world. Nobody can disturb our peace there.”\\n\\nMandhakini smiled as if she understood his words.\\n\\nThe scene shifted.\\n\\nEmperor Sundara Chozhan, his Queen and his children were having a joy ride in\\nRiver Cauvery. They were on a boat which was designed to look like Raja Hams,\\nthe celestial bird. The country’s finest musicians were entertaining the King. The\\nEmperor was enjoying the music. His eyes were closed.\\n\\nHe was jolted by a scream coming from the other side of the boat.\\n\\n“Oh My God! WHERE IS THE CHILD? MY GOD, WHERE IS PRINCE\\n\\n\\x0cARULMOZHI?”\\n\\nThe Emperor opened his eyes. He looked around.\\n\\nA woman was holding his darling son, Arulmozhi. The woman was virtually\\nstanding on water. And she was trying to drown the Prince.\\n\\nThe Emperor could not contain his fury. He was about to jump into the river\\nwhen he saw the face of the woman. He recognised the evil face of Mandhakini.\\nThe recognition paralyzed him. He fell down on the boat with a loud thud.\\n\\nThe sudden fall woke him up from the horrible dream. He could not sleep any\\nlonger.\\n\\nThe bed-chamber was very cool, thanks to the rain and the storm. And yet the\\nEmperor was bathed in sweat.\\n\\nHe was a tad relieved when he realized that whatever happened till then was just\\na dream.\\n\\nHe looked in front of him. There was nobody in the room. An oil lamp lighted\\nthe room.\\n\\nHe thought that others would have left the room because he was sleeping.\\n\\n\\x0cHe first thought of clapping his hands to call them back. Then he decided against\\nit.\\n\\nLet me wait for some time. Let me recover from the shock of my evening dream.\\n\\nHe heard a faint sound coming from the terrace. What could that be? He turned\\ntowards the direction of the sound. He saw a figure coming down from the\\nterrace. The figure was holding the pillar for support. Was it also a dream or\\nreality? Or was it a hallucination?\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 32 - “Why Do You Torment Me?”\\n\\nSundara Chozhan was surprised.\\n\\nI see somebody coming down from the terrace through the pillars. Who can that\\nbe? He remembered the confusing dreams he had.\\n\\nIs this a continuance of the dream? Have I not woken up fully yet?\\n\\nThe Emperor closed his eyes for a whole minute and then opened them again.\\nHe looked in the direction where the mysterious figure got down from the pillar.\\nHe could not see anything. He concluded that it must have been a hallucination.\\n\\nHe remembered what happened before he dozed off to sleep. The Chief Minister,\\nhis disciple, Azhwarkkadian and Thiagavidangar’s daughter who sang in a sweet\\nvoice had gone. The Empress and the maids were waiting for his call in the\\nadjacent room.\\n\\nThe Emperor remembered the manner in which he spoke of his daughter,\\nPrincess Kunthavai, to the Chief Minister. Wasn’t he complaining about her? He\\nfelt a strong sense of remorse. Kunthavai’s planning and intelligence was\\nunmatched. She had thought deeply over the matter and finally decided to keep\\nthe Prince at Nagapattinam to prevent any possible civil commotion in the\\nKingdom. And to belittle her forethought had been his greatest blunder, mused\\nthe Emperor. Sundara Chozhan knew very well that his mind was not at its best\\nin the recent past.\\n\\n\\x0cThe Princess did nothing wrong. Why then did I blame her? It is prudent to leave\\neverything to her decision. The first priority now is to bring the Prince from\\nNagapattinam. Oh My God! He should not have been caught in the storm and\\nthe floods. I should ask Kunthavai about it right now.\\n\\nSundara Chozhar decided to clap his hands to call those waiting for him in the\\nnext room.\\n\\nBut what is happening? I can sense some movement near the head of my bed.\\nBut the sound of the footsteps is very soft - something like those of a cat, a tiger\\nor a leopard. Who is that? Is that my Queen? Or my daughter? Or a maid?\\nPerhaps they do not want to disturb my sleep. That is why they are walking\\nsoftly.\\n\\n“Who is that” - The Emperor asked in a soft voice. There was no response.\\n\\n“Who is that? Come before me.” The Emperor shouted. There was no response\\neven now.\\n\\nThe Emperor had a sudden flash.\\n\\nIs it her? The woman whose only mission in life is to confuse and frighten me?\\nOr her ghost? The devil that came in my dream has come in person as well. She\\nused to come only at mid-night. Now she has come early in the evening, that too\\nfully dressed and bejewelled? Or perhaps it is already midnight? Have I slept\\nthat long? Perhaps that’s why my Queen and my daughter are not here with me.\\n\\n\\x0cThe maids have gone to sleep too. Oh My God! They have left me all alone. And\\nif this is that devil she won’t let me be in peace. She won’t leave me till my heart\\nbursts in shock and grief.\\n\\n“Devil! If it’s you, then for heaven’s sake, come before me. Torture me in\\nwhatever way you can. And then leave me alone. I can’t simply stand your\\nhovering near the head of my bed, completely invisible to me? You are killing\\nme.\\n\\nCome before me. Come to my presence. Have you come to draw my blood? Kill\\nme with the knife you use to kill the tigers and bears of the forest. But, please, I\\nbeg of you, please don’t hurt my children. Yes, I have wronged you. But don’t\\ntake revenge on my innocent children. They have never hurt you. They never\\neven thought of doing so. Tell me, what wrong did I do to you? Did I ask you to\\njump from the light house and kill yourself? You did that on your own. Why are\\nyou tormenting me?”\\n\\nSundara Chozhan felt the presence of the mysterious figure very close to him.\\nHis body trembled in fear. He felt as if his intestines had coiled up and blocked\\nhis chest. And that his heart rolled up and blocked his throat. He felt as if his\\neyes were bulging out of his face that they may soon fall down.\\n\\nYes, it’s her. The fisherman’s daughter, who has been torturing me for a long,\\nlong time. No, it’s not her but her ghost! The ghost has come for its ultimate\\nrevenge. It is now thirsty. For blood. It wants to draw blood. Blood for blood!\\n\\nEither the ghost will stab me or might wring my neck and suffocate me to death.\\nLet her wish be fulfilled. What’s the point in my living? I won’t be of any use to\\nanybody. And if the ghost kills me now, then it won’t hurt my children. It’s better\\nthat way.\\n\\n\\x0cSundara Chozhan felt that if only he lifted his head a little and look deeply he\\nwould see the ghost of Mandhakini. It appeared as if the mysterious figure was\\nvery close to his head. He could even feel the ghost’s shadow falling on him. He\\nwanted to lift his head to have a look. At least once. But he could not gather\\nenough courage for that scary task.\\n\\nLet me close my eyes tight. Let it do whatever it wants to.\\n\\nThe Emperor did not move. Nothing happened. A sharp knife did not pierce his\\nheart. Nor did some ghostly hands wring his neck. It appeared as if the ghost had\\nmoved away from him.\\n\\nNo, she would not let me die so easily. She would rather prefer to keep me alive\\nso that she can torment me whenever she feels like it. Somehow she managed to\\nescape my eyes today. Let me call somebody. If there are other people around,\\nshe will vanish.\\n\\n“Anybody there? Where have you all gone?” - The Emperor shouted before he\\nopened his eyes.\\n\\nOh My God! Who is standing at the foot of my bed? Yes, it’s her. There is no\\ndoubt about it. It’s that mute ghost. And like a typical ghost she has let her hair\\nloose. I can see blood on her forehead. Perhaps she is telling me in sign\\nlanguage that she has come to draw blood. Blood for blood! My blood!\\n\\nSundara Chozhan shouted at the figure as if he were possessed.\\n\\n\\x0c“YOU DUMB DEVIL! You tortured me with your silence even when you were\\nalive. And you are torturing me with your silence even now. Why have you\\ncome here? If you want blood, take it. Take all the blood in my body. It’s all\\nyours. Why are you standing like that? Why do wear that pitiable expression on\\nyour face? Have you come to demand anything else? Then tell me. What do you\\nwant? Tell me. If you can’t talk at least show some signs. Don’t torture me by\\njust standing before me doing nothing.\\n\\n“Why are your eyes brimming with tears? Are you crying, by any chance? I\\ncan’t stand it. If you have something to say, please speak. Or else, get lost. You\\nwon’t go? You refuse to go? Why are you adamant? Aren’t you the one who\\ntried to smother my son, my little innocent child to death, in Cauvery? Because\\nof God’s grace it didn’t happen. Your plan did not succeed then. Nor will it ever\\nsucceed in future. Because God is on my side. Devil! Why are you staring at me\\ntrying to tear my heart off my chest with your sharp eyes? Go! Go! Get lost! You\\nwon’t go? Well, I’ll drive you out of this place. I’ll make you go.”\\n\\nThe Emperor looked for something handy to throw at Mandhakini. There was a\\nsmall oil lamp near him. It was sturdy as it was made from an alloy of five\\nmetals. The King picked up that lamp. “Go. Get lost, you hungry ghost!” The\\nKing shouted while throwing the lamp aiming for Mandhakini’s face. It was like\\nthe Lord Vishnu releasing his Golden Disc. The lamp was still burning as it flew\\ntowards the hapless woman.\\n\\nAt that time the figure whom the Emperor thought was a ghost moaned in\\nunbearable grief.\\n\\nIt was a high pitch moan. The Emperor’s body shrivelled. His body, the flesh and\\nbones inside his body and even his bone marrow froze.\\n\\n\\x0cFortunately the burning lamp missed its target. It fell before the ghost-figure\\nwith a reverberating sound.\\n\\nThe lamp went off. And yet the room was not dark. There was another lamp in\\nthe other side of the room. Sundara Chozhan saw the figure still standing there\\nin the faint light. There was inexplicable grief on the face of the figure. The\\nfigure looked at the Emperor longingly for a second before attempting to go.\\n\\nIt was at that time that the doubt first appeared in the Emperor’s mind.\\n\\nIs it the ghost of Mandhakini? Or some lady who is almost like her? Or her twinsister? Or perhaps... perhaps... perhaps... it’s Mandhakini herself? Then didn’t\\nshe die? Is she still alive? Whatever I have been thinking till now is wrong. And\\nif it’s her then Oh My God! What have I done? I tried to throw the lamp at her\\nand kill her. What a cruelty! What a heartless act! That explains the change in\\nher expression. Her face shone in sympathy for a while. And then it plunged into\\ngrief. No ordinary grief. Grief that cannot be expressed in words.\\n\\nWas she hurt by his cruel act? Oh My God! That’s why she is trying to go. She is\\nlooking on all sides. She is planning to run away.\\n\\n“Are you there! Are you the Fisherman’s daughter, Mandhakini? Or her ghost?\\nOr her sister? STOP! STOP! Don’t go. Please tell me truth before you leave.\\nPLEASE!”\\n\\nAs the Emperor was hollering at the mysterious figure several people entered the\\n\\n\\x0cchamber at the same time making a terrible noise. The Empress, Princess\\nKunthavai, Vanathi, Poonkuzhali, the Chief Minister, his disciple\\nAzhwarkkadian rushed into the room together.\\n\\n“STOP. Don’t let her run away from here. Ask her why she came here?” - The\\nEmperor screamed.”\\n\\nEveryone was shocked. The rage on the Emperor’s face and the horror in his\\nvoice shocked them. They were even more shocked on seeing Mandhakini Devi\\nat that place. They remained frozen for a moment.\\n\\nThe Chief Minister assessed the situation and inferred what could have possibly\\nhappened when they were away. He asked Poonkuzhali:\\n\\n“Hey Gal, is she your aunt?”\\n\\n“Yes, Minister Sir.”\\n\\nHe then barked orders to his disciple.\\n\\n“Thirumalai, why are you standing like a statue? Mandhakini Devi is trying to\\nrun away. Stop her! It’s the Emperor’s command.”\\n\\nFor the first time in his life Azhwarkkadian defied his Master’s orders.\\n\\n\\x0c“You could have ordered me to stop a cyclone, Master. That could have been\\neasier.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali ran to Mandhakini and caught hold of her shoulders. Mandhakini\\nthrew her niece’s hands and ran away.\\n\\nAzhwarkkadian acted smart. He ran to the door. He bolted it and stood guard\\nnear it. Nobody could open the door either from inside or from outside.\\n\\nMandhakini Devi now looked like a deer surrounded by hunters. She decided\\nthat there was no other way to escape except the route she had taken while\\ncoming in. When she looked at the terrace everyone understood her plans.\\n\\nThe Emperor was delirious:\\n\\n“Stop her! Catch her! Ask her why she came. Ask her whom does she wants to\\nkill.”\\n\\nMandhakini was preparing to go to the terrace through the pillar near her.\\nPoonkuzhali ran up to her. This time Poonkuzhali did not try to stop her. She\\nspoke to her in sign language. Mandhakini seemed to understand her signs and\\npointed out the oil lamp lying in the floor.\\n\\nPrincess Kunthavai understood the signs.\\n\\n\\x0c“Appa, did you throw the oil lamp at Periamma?”\\n\\n“Yes, dear. I could not bear the look of that ghost. I threw the lamp to drive her\\naway.”\\n\\n“Oh, my dear father, she is not a ghost or a spirit. She is very much a living\\nwoman, the best among women. She is my Periamma. She is very much alive.\\nAsk the Chief Minister. He’ll tell you everything.”\\n\\nKunthavai told her father and ran to the place where Poonkuzhali and\\nMandhakini were engaged in a wordless conversation.\\n\\nThe Emperor saw his daughter going near Mandhakini.\\n\\n“Dear, don’t go near her. That devil might harm you.”\\n\\nThe Emperor tried to get up from his bed. His love for his daughter made him\\nforget the fact that he could not stand on his own.\\n\\nThe Empress held the Emperor’s shoulders affectionately and made him lie on\\nhis bed.\\n\\n“Be patient, my Lord. Nothing will happen to your darling daughter. She is in\\n\\n\\x0csafe hands.”\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 33 - The Goddess Of The Chozha Clan\\n\\nPrincess Kunthavai went near Mandhakini. Mandhakini looked deep into the\\neyes of the Princess. What the Princess did next was a surprise to everybody in\\nthe room. She prostrated before Mandhakini and touched her feet.\\n\\nMandhakini’s eyes were full. She bent down, lifted the Princess up and hugged\\nher. Princess drew her closer and then joined her right hand with hers. While\\nremaining in that position she slowly led Mandhakini to the Emperor.\\n\\nIt was only then the Empress saw the face of Mandhakini. She saw blood on the\\nforehead of the Mute Queen. She turned to her husband.\\n\\n“My Lord, was it you who threw the lamp at her and hurt her? What have you\\ndone, my Lord!” - The Queen almost screamed.\\n\\n“No, no. The lamp I threw did not reach her. She was like this even before I\\nthrew the lamp. But this evil woman might put the blame on me. And you’ll only\\nbelieve her words. I know that all of you are on her side. Oh Malaiyaman’s\\ndaughter! I am surprised you too have a soft corner for this devil. Do you know\\nwho she is?”\\n\\nThe Empress roared.\\n\\n“I do, my Lord? She is my Goddess. She is the Goddess, the presiding deity of\\n\\n\\x0cthe Chozha Clan. When my dear son Arulmozhi was about to be drowned in\\nRiver Cauvery, he was saved only by the grace of this Goddess.”\\n\\n“Oh My God! You too believe that story? Did Kunthavai ask you to believe such\\nincredible stories?”\\n\\n“No, My Lord. I am just describing what I saw with my own eyes. Kunthavai\\nwas a child at that time and she could not have known. She saved our son\\nArulmozhi on that day. Earlier she saved you from the clutches of a bear at the\\nGhost Island in Srilanka. She saved you for the Chozha Kingdom. But for her,\\nthe clan would have lost a wonderful Emperor. That’s why I am worshipping her\\nas the Goddess of the Chozha clan.”\\n\\n“Oh My God! you know that too? And do you know that she has been alive all\\nthese days? And not dead as believed earlier?”\\n\\n“I know, my Lord. I was telling our Chief Minister to bring her somehow from\\nSrilanka.”\\n\\n“Chief Minister, did you hear the Queen? Is she really that Fisherman’s\\ndaughter? Is she still alive? Didn’t you say that she is dead? Did you lie to me? I\\nthought her evil spirit came often to torment me. Was that all mere\\nhallucination? I am already in a state of confusion. And now you have all joined\\nhands to make me absolutely mad. God bless you all.”\\n\\n“Your Majesty, she is the one. It’s true. She is alive. I am the one who’s guilty,\\nmy Lord. There is no scope for a pardon. Even then I have hopes on your\\nmercy..... Your Highness”\\n\\n\\x0c“Chief Minister, now I know. This is the woman whom you forcibly abducted\\nfrom Kodikkarai. You said that the woman who came in the palanquin was this\\nboat girl. Even that’s a lie, Minister.”\\n\\n“King of Kings, please have mercy on me. I beg your pardon.”\\n\\n“Aha! Begging my Pardon! Good joke! I think this is the first time in the history\\nof the world that a person described as an Emperor and King of Kings was lied\\nto and deceived. Why did you hide things from me? Why didn’t you tell me\\nearlier? You were talking to me for a long time this evening. You could have told\\nme at least at that time. But you didn’t. It’s only now things have become clear\\nto me. I see the truth in what Pazhuvettaraiyars say. You have all joined hands to\\nconspire against me.”\\n\\n“I concede, Your Majesty, this is a conspiracy. But the conspiracy is not against\\nyou. The only thought we all had in our minds was to somehow bring this lady\\nto you. I learnt from the Queen that you were still grieving over the death of this\\nwoman. That prompted me to take this decision. The Queen concurred with me.\\nShe virtually ordered me to do so. But it was not easy to bring this woman, Your\\nMajesty. If I tell you that she is alive without producing her before you, you’ll\\nfind it difficult to believe. That’s why I decided to bring the woman somehow to\\nyour presence and then tell the story. Mandhakini Devi had come till the gates of\\nthe Fort yesterday and then she vanished. This boat girl came in her place in the\\npalanquin. We spent the whole day today looking for Mandhakini Devi. My\\ndisciple saw her climbing the wall of Pazhuvur Palace. And then he did the same\\nthing only to apprehend her. But she was not to be seen inside the palace either.\\nMeanwhile my disciple was caught by the guards of Pazhuvur Palace. Your\\nMajesty, I beg of you to kindly pardon my disciple for that trespass.”\\n\\n“Is that the only offence which needs a pardon? There are many. Continue the\\n\\n\\x0cnarration.”\\n\\n“We waited till evening. We looked for her inside the Pazhuvur Palace. She was\\nnot found. When you were sleeping we were in the adjacent room talking about\\nthis lady. We suspected that the lady might be hiding somewhere around here\\nand we did not know how to tell you that. And now the lady has come to your\\nplace herself. The fruit that slipped from the hand has fallen into milk.”\\n\\nThe Emperor then looked in the direction of Mandhakini. Kunthavai and\\nPoonkuzhali were giving first aid to her. They used a wet cloth to gently wipe off\\nthe blood and applied cool sandal paste over the wound.\\n\\nThe Emperor asked Poonkuzhali.\\n\\n“Vidangar’s daughter, ask your aunt how she got hurt.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali came forward and spoke reverentially.\\n\\n“I asked, Your Majesty. But I can’t understand her words.”\\n\\n“What does she say? Does she by any chance say that the wound was caused by\\nthe lamp I threw at her?”\\n\\n“Not at all, Your Highness. She says that she hit against a hill. And that she did\\nnot notice that she was bleeding.”\\n\\n\\x0cThe Emperor did something totally unexpected. He started laughing aloud. For\\nyears nobody had seen the Emperor laughing so loudly and so happily. It\\nappeared as if he thought of something funny again and again and his laugh\\nbecame louder and louder. Everyone was watching him with concern.\\n\\n“Chief Minister, why are you staring at me? Are you thinking that I’ve become\\nmad once again? Not at all! You want to know the reason for my laugh? This\\nlady is telling that she hit upon a hill. And that too in the Chozha country. How\\ncan I not laugh, tell me! Why talk about a hill? There is not even enough stone to\\nmake a small statue here in Chozha Kingdom. Even if somebody wants to throw\\na stone at the Chozha Emperor he has to import it from outside. And now this\\nlady claims that she hit against a hill in Chozha Kingdom. What hill did he hit\\nagainst? Poonkuzhali, why don’t you ask her?”\\n\\nVanathi was listening to this conversation. Her face glowed all of a sudden. She\\nunderstood. She came two feet forward and paid her respects to the Emperor.\\n\\n“Your Majesty, I know what she says. I’ll be happy to share my knowledge if I\\nhave the permission of Your Highness.”\\n\\n“Kodumbalur Princess! You too are here? I didn’t see you till now. I am\\nsurprised that you have not fainted in this melee. Tell me what you think about\\nthe lady’s words.”\\n\\n“This Devi said that she was hurt because she hit against the hill. I think I know\\nwhat she means.”\\n\\n\\x0c“What is that? I know you are a smart girl. You might have understood the real\\nreason. Come on. Fast! Tell me! Does she want to say that she hit against a hill\\nin Lanka and came here bleeding?”\\n\\n“No, my Lord. There’s a hall of sculptures in the Palace Garden. In that hall\\nthere’s a sculpture depicting the Demon Ravana holding the Kailash Mountain\\naloft. Perhaps she hit against that mountain.”\\n\\nEveryone was surprised at Vanathi’s beautiful insight.\\n\\n“May be.”\\n\\n“Quite Possible.”\\n\\n“That’s it.” - People were exclaiming while glancing at Vanathi with admiration.\\n\\nPrincess Kunthavai placed her hand on Vanathi’s forehead. And then she\\nmimicked the gesture to ward off evil eyes.\\n\\n“You are a genius, my dear. That didn’t strike us at all. I am very happy, dear.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali was looking at the scene with raw fury in her eyes. She then spoke\\nto her aunt in sign language and relayed the conversation to the audience.\\n\\n\\x0c“Yes, that’s what she says. It’s the mountain in the Sculptures Hall that hit her. I\\ntoo would have guessed it right had I seen the hall earlier.”\\n\\nThe Emperor was now staring at Mandhakini.\\n\\n“Yes. She did not know where to go. And hit against the sculpted mountain. We\\ndon’t know where she wanted to go. She arrived here at last.”\\n\\nThe Minister responded to the Emperor.\\n\\n“She wanted to meet you, Your Majesty. There is no doubt about it. She was\\nlooking for a way to do it. I was telling these people that she won’t go without\\nseeing you.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe that, Chief Minister. If she had wanted to come she could have\\ncome earlier. She did not turn up for twenty five years. Why should she come\\nnow? Why should she haunt me like a ghost? Yes, yes. I thought she was dead\\nand was hovering in the Palace as a ghost. In a way that’s also true. Wasn’t she\\nroaming the dense forests of Lanka like a ghost? All the time I spent my life\\nindulging in the royal pleasures of a Palace. I don’t have words to describe the\\npower of nemesis. I don’t know how many times I was shocked in the past\\nseeing this woman’s ghostly form. Who knows? She might have come on earlier\\noccasions too by stealth to see me. I was terrified because I thought she was a\\nghost. Oh My God! Twenty five years! Twenty five long years! Twenty five\\ncenturies! Twenty five aeons!”\\n\\nThe Emperor was speaking to himself. He suddenly stopped and turned towards\\nthe Minister,\\n\\n\\x0c“Chief Minister, didn’t you seek my pardon for your crimes? May I know what\\nare you guilty of?”\\n\\n“Your Excellency, it’s neither proper nor just to ask the accused to read out his\\nown charge sheet.”\\n\\n“Then whom can I ask? Well, I need not ask anybody. The crime is written\\nclearly on your face. It’s as clear as the writing on the wall. You told me that this\\nlady fell into the sea and killed herself. That’s a lie. You’ve been repeating the lie\\nfor the past twenty-five years. And I believed you. Minister, yours is a heinous\\ncrime.”\\n\\n“Your Highness, I am not the only one to be charged. This lady is an accessory\\nto the crime. It is true that she fell into the sea. She was rescued. It was almost a\\nrebirth for her. She made me promise to her that I should never reveal to you that\\nshe is alive. I refused to give such a promise. Then she threatened to kill herself.\\nI had no other go, Your Majesty. Now is the time, Your Majesty. You can ask her\\nwhether I speak the truth.”\\n\\n“No need, Minister. Let it be like what you said. Even then it doesn’t change the\\nfact that you all joined hands to conspire against me. That was what I said\\nearlier. It’s not wrong.”\\n\\n“I do concede, Your Highness, there is no pardon for the grave offence I\\ncommitted. I have been carrying this in my mind for several years. The load has\\nbeen lifted today. I am free now. Please relieve me, Your Highness. I am\\nplanning to go to Srirengam to serve my Lord Renganatha. I want to spend the\\nrest of my life in His service, Your Majesty.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Impossible, Chief Minister! Your crime has led to many a confusion. It is your\\nduty to clear them before serving Lord Renganatha.”\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 34 - Ravana In Danger\\n\\nThe Emperor spoke softly to his daughter - “Kunthavai, I need to discuss some\\nsensitive political issues with the Chief Minister. You may all go out to attend to\\nyour work. When you go out, take “ this” with you. Let your mother be with me\\nfor some time.”\\n\\nThe way the Emperor referred to Mandhakini as “this” showed his hatred for her.\\n\\nKunthavai looked at her father with disappointment in her eyes. The Emperor\\nnoticed her expression:\\n\\n“It is better to check on this woman. Did she really hit against Mount Kailash\\nsculpture in the Hall as she claims? Take her there to find that out. I can’t bear\\nher standing here.”\\n\\nKunthavai’s face fell. She held Mandhakini’s hand and led her out of the\\nchambers. The Empress came near Kunthavai and whispered into her ears.\\n“Darling, isn’t she horrible to look at? What’s the point in blaming your father?\\nTake this lady with you and show all your artistic talents on her. Make her a\\nbeautiful woman and bring her back.”\\n\\nKunthavai smiled to acknowledge the wonderful suggestion coming from the\\nEmpress. Vanathi and Poonkuzhali went along with her.\\n\\n\\x0cSundara Chozhan looked alternately at the Empress and the Chief Minister.\\n\\n“I don’t know why you did this to me. If you think that this will make me happy\\nthen I’m sorry to say, you’re grossly mistaken. Chief Minister, why the hell did\\nyou take so much effort to bring that barbaric creature from Kodikkarai? Tell me\\nthe truth at least now. At least from now on please do not hide anything from\\nme.”\\n\\nThe Chief Minister’s response was quite emotional:\\n\\n“Your Highness I’ll never repeat the same blunder again. I will never hide\\nanything from you. I tried hard only to bring out the truth. You were torturing\\nyourself because you thought this woman died because of you. I thought that you\\nhad forgotten that altogether. Later I came to know that you could never forget\\nthat; or forgive yourself for that. The Empress told me that on many days you\\ndreamt about this woman and shrieked in the middle of the night. The grief of\\nthe Empress was much more than yours, Your Highness. She asked my advice\\non the matter. We started working on this, Your Highness. You thought that you\\nwere responsible for the death of that woman. So we thought that the best way to\\nremove your guilt is to produce the lady before you. We could not think of any\\nother way to assuage your feelings of guilt. We thought you won’t believe us\\nunless you see her in person. That led to all this mess, Your Highness. If you\\nthink our motives are wrong, we seek your forgiveness.”\\n\\nThese words actually added fuel to the fire.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s wrong. It’s a crime. Till today she was haunting me as a devil. She was\\ndisturbing me in my dreams. And you have replaced the ghost with a mad\\nwoman. Do you think that this will give me happiness? Never! If only you had\\nconsulted me before, I would have vetoed the idea of bringing her to my\\n\\n\\x0cpresence. You were all over-enthusiastic. I will let this pass. You took enormous\\ntrouble to bring her here. Tell me how are you going to dispose her off?”\\n\\nThe Chief Minister was rendered speechless with this outburst.\\n\\nThe Empress stepped forward to speak.\\n\\n“My Lord, I don’t have any idea of letting my sister go away. Let her stay with\\nme in this palace. I will shower my love on her as if she were my elder sister.”\\n\\n“Devi, there is no need to prove your love for me by these gestures. I have\\nknown in the past twenty five years of living with you, that when it comes to\\nloving one’s husband, you are better than even the legendary Kannaki. Ever\\nsince I was afflicted with this dreaded disease you have even neglected your\\nchildren to look after me. I know what you are doing for me. I know the fast and\\npenance you undertook for my sake. And you need not let a mad woman who till\\nnow was roaming in a forest, live with you to prove your love for me. Now,\\nlisten to me, Oh Malaiyaman’s daughter! And this is for you too, Chief Minister.\\n\\n“Somewhere in the past when I was staying alone in an uninhabited island I saw\\nthis dumb, mad woman. It’s true that I fell in love with her. I am not denying\\nthat. But if you think that I am still longing for her company, there cannot be a\\ngreater blunder than that. There were so many reasons for my falling in love\\nwith her at that time. And that love has now changed into hatred and even\\ndisgust. She now torments me in my dreams and even in reality. I can’t even bear\\nto think that she is living in this Palace. Drive her out. Right now! I thought she\\nwas a ghost and hence threw the oil lamp at her. If I had known that she was\\nalive I don’t know what I would have done to her.”\\n\\n\\x0cThe Empress and the Chief Minister were devastated by the revulsion in the\\nEmperor’s voice. They never expected the Emperor to be so cruel. The Chief\\nMinister thought that the Emperor might admonish him only for the earlier lie.\\nThe Empress thought that the Emperor might not praise her openly; but inwardly\\nhe might appreciate her thoughtful act of bringing the first love of his life.\\n\\nThey were disappointed by the Emperor’s words. They were furious with the\\nEmperor. They even started hating him for his harsh words.\\n\\nAnd the Emperor’s final outburst was the worst.\\n\\n“The world won’t lose anything if this dumb, mad woman dies. If only she had\\ndied when she fell into the sea... it could have been much better. Which idiot\\nsaved her?”\\n\\nThe Empress could not bear it any longer.\\n\\n“My Lord, I beg of you. Please don’t talk like that. Our elders have said that of\\nall the sins committed by man, ingratitude is the worst. You can even forget the\\nfact that your life was once saved by this woman. But how can you afford to\\nforget the fact that our darling son Arulmozhivarman is alive today only because\\nof her? You can, my Lord. But I can’t. I will be indebted to this angel in all my\\nfourteen births.”\\n\\n“Devi, why are you repeating the old story now?”\\n\\n\\x0cThe Empress did not let him complete.\\n\\n“That’s not a story, my Lord. That’s a fact. Arulmozhi told me. He told me that\\nthe same angel who saved him from the floods in River Cauvery also saved him\\nfrom dangers in Lanka. Thank God he is safe at Nagapattinam. Let him be\\nbrought here, my Lord. You can find out the truth from him.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes. Arulmozhi is in Nagapattinam. But what is the guarantee that he is\\nsafe? Was he caught in the yesterday’s storm? I am worried, dear. Chief Minister,\\nI am restless. I have lost my peace. I have a strong premonition that a calamity is\\nabout to happen to my clan. And this dumb devil coming here at this time looks\\nlike a bad omen to me.”\\n\\n“No, my Lord! Definitely not! The divine woman coming here is definitely not a\\nbad omen. I will say that her presence here is possibly the best security for our\\nclan. I am sure my Holy Mother Durga Parameswari, pleased by my constant\\nprayers, has sent her here.”\\n\\n“No, not at all! She was not sent by Durga Parameswari, but by the Saturn, the\\nevil God. Send her away. If you fail to do that I’ll do it myself.”\\n\\n“My Lord, I beg of you, please grant me this boon. Let the woman stay in our\\nPalace till Arulmozhi comes here.”\\n\\nThe Queen’s voice was choked. And to strengthen her prayer she bowed down\\nand touched the Emperor’s feet.\\n\\n\\x0c“Did you hear that plea, Chief Minister? The passionate plea coming from\\nMalaiyaman’s daughter. The plea coming from a woman who still believes that\\nall that glitters is gold. I don’t think there can be anybody in the world half as\\ngullible as her. She has never asked anything from me till now. And the very first\\nboon she has asked from me is like this. What can I do, tell me. I don’t have the\\nheart to refuse her request. But take it from me, every minute the dumb devil\\nstays in this palace will be hell for me. So make arrangements to bring the Prince\\nfrom Nagapattinam immediately.”\\n\\n“As you wish, Your Highness. Shall I openly send our cavalry and our elephantregiment to bring back the Prince or else… “\\n\\n“You want to bring him in disguise. In stealth. Without anybody knowing it.\\nRight? And you think if the Prince were to come here openly there will be chaos\\nin our Kingdom. Right?”\\n\\n“I don’t just think, Your Highness. I know for sure. The people are agitated for\\nvarious reasons. They are waiting for some excuse now. And if they have it there\\nwill be a revolution. I can’t say what will happen to the Pazhuvettaraiyars and\\nMadhuranthakan.”\\n\\n“What are you talking, Chief Minister? If people become unruly then what\\nhappened to our vast army? Can’t they quell the violence?”\\n\\n“The army is even more agitated than the people, Your Highness. People will at\\nthe most shout a few slogans and walk away. But our army won’t rest until they\\ndemolish the Thanjavur Fort, imprison the Pazhuvettaraiyars and\\nMadhuranthakan and place Arulmozhi on the Chozha throne.”\\n\\n\\x0c“It seems you too want the same to happen. People are confused by the cock and\\nbull stories woven by some foolish astrologers. But have this firmly in your\\nheart. My cousin - my grandfather’s brother’s son - Madhuranthakan is the only\\nrightful heir to the Chozha throne. I have decided to make him the Emperor. I\\ndon’t care if people object to that. I don’t care even if the gods or the Holy\\nTrinity opposes my decision. And if my sons oppose my decision... well they\\nhad it.”\\n\\nThe Empress intervened.\\n\\n“That will never happen, my Lord. Your sons will never go against your wishes.\\nArulmozhi is not enamoured by the throne. The Lankan Crown was offered to\\nhim literally on a platter. He refused it. Do you think that a person of such a\\ncalibre will go against your wishes? What about your elder son, Karikalan? It\\nwas you, my Lord, who made him the Crown Prince. That was the only reason\\nhe accepted that position. Should I tell about his strength and valour? He is\\ncapable of creating a kingdom for himself with the help of his sword. But he too\\nis not interested in being the King. You just have to tell him what’s in your mind,\\nmy Lord.”\\n\\n“He is afraid that I might tell that to him. He doesn’t want to hear that from me.\\nThat is why he refuses to come here. I have sent for him many times.”\\n\\n“Your Majesty, the Crown Prince has built a golden palace for you at\\nKancheepuram and is waiting for you.”\\n\\n“I know what he is waiting for. You know Kamsa of mythology? Kamsa threw\\nhis parents behind bars and became the king. In the same way this son of mine\\nwill put us in prison and then ascend the Chozha throne. I don’t know whether\\nhe has built a golden palace or a treacherous palace of lac, like the one built by\\n\\n\\x0cKauravas to kill Pandavas.”\\n\\nThe Empress was shocked.\\n\\n“Your charge against our son Karikalan is quite terrible. I can’t bear to hear it,\\nmy Lord!”\\n\\nThe Chief Minister told in an emotional voice.\\n\\n“The Emperor’s mind has been poisoned by the evil elements.”\\n\\n“Nobody can poison my mind except my own son, Karikalan. If he is truly my\\nson why didn’t he come here in spite of my repeated requests?”\\n\\n“He must have strong reasons, my Lord.”\\n\\n“Why don’t you guess at least one of those strong reasons?”\\n\\n“People say that if Karikalan crosses River Coleroon he might be arrested by the\\nPazhuvettaraiyars.”\\n\\n“Somebody has spoilt my son’s mind. I know who did that. Probably this\\nwoman’s father, Thirukkovalur Malaiyaman. And another person is Kodumbalur\\n\\n\\x0cVelar. Perhaps you have also joined the gang, Chief Minister.”\\n\\n“My Lord, I never talk behind people’s backs. A short while ago you talked\\nabout some danger and the strong sense of premonition. That’s true, my Lord. A\\ncalamity awaits the Chozha clan. That can come in two ways. There are two\\ndifferent conspiracies happening against our clan right now. The\\nPazhuvettaraiyars and the Sambuvaraiyars.”\\n\\n“Stop it, Chief Minister! The Pazhuvettaraiyar clan has been serving our clan for\\nmore than a hundred years. The Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar has fought in twenty\\nfour battle-fronts and has sustained sixty four wounds for the sake of our\\ncountry. Instead of saying that such a man is working against the interest of\\nChozhas you can very well say that the sun has lost its light. That will be more\\ncredible, Minister.”\\n\\n“Your Highness, even the great sun is caught in an eclipse once in a while. Our\\nscriptures say that a great fire is there underneath the cool waters of an ocean. I\\nam not talking about that, Your Majesty. I am not saying that the\\nPazhuvettaraiyars are working against the Chozha clan. I am only saying that\\nthey are desperate on crowning Madhuranthakan.”\\n\\n“What is wrong in that, Minister? What is wrong in desiring the Crown for the\\nonly son of the greatest devotees of Lord Shiva, the great Kandaraathithar? And\\nMadhuranthakan is after all the rightful heir to the throne.”\\n\\n“I do not deny that, Your Highness. You have come forward to give the throne to\\nMadhuranthakan. Then how can Pazhuvettaraiyars be blamed. They are only\\nworking overtime to carry out your wishes.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Hence they deserve more gratitude from me and my family.”\\n\\n“But, Your Highness, they also do certain things without your permission. They\\nare planning to divide the Chozha Kingdom into two parts and give the one\\nSouth of Cauvery to Madhuranthakan and the one north of Cauvery to\\nKarikalan. That is the discussion currently going on in Sambuvaraiyar’s Palace.\\nYour Highness, do you agree for splitting this great country? Remember Your\\nMajesty, it took more than a hundred years of struggle for your ancestors like\\nVijayaalaya Chozhan, Adithya Chozhan and the Great Paranthaka to consolidate\\nand expand the borders of this magnificent kingdom from Srilanka to Godavari\\nin the North. Do you agree to break the great Kingdom, Your Majesty?”\\n\\n“Chief Minister, I will never, never consent to that absurd idea. I will rather ask\\nthem to split me into two before splitting the Chozha Kingdom. I don’t think\\nPazhuvettaraiyar will take part in such a disastrous act. I don’t believe that,\\nMinister. Perhaps he is doing that out of his love for me. Perhaps he wants to\\ngive at least half the kingdom to my son. But if only he knows that I don’t like\\nthe split he’d abandon the idea. I will make Madhuranthakan the King. And I’ll\\nsee to that his Kingdom is not even an inch less than the one I ruled. I won’t care\\neven if the people oppose me. I won’t care even if Pazhuvettaraiyar opposes that\\nidea. I’ll listen to none. Is that clear?”\\n\\n“Your Highness, you can ignore Pazhuvettaraiyar’s opposition. Your sons are not\\ngoing to oppose you. But these are not the only blocks in making\\nMadhuranthakan the King. The opposition is coming from a much higher place.\\nThe opposition comes from a lady whom the people of Chozha Kingdom\\nworship as a Goddess. I tried talking to her a few days ago... “\\n\\n“I know you are referring to Queen Mother, Sembian Madevi. Somebody has\\npoisoned her mind too. She thinks that I want to crown my son. Chief Minister,\\nplease make arrangements to bring her here immediately. I’ll change her mind.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Your Highness, it is easier said than done. The great Saint Kandaraathithar has\\ngiven the orders to his wife before he died. I was with him when he died. I still\\nremember his words. “Madhuranthakan should never be crowned. I have a very,\\nvery strong reason. Only my wife knows it.” Those were his exact words.”\\n\\n“Chief Minister, is there really such a strong reason against Madhuranthakan\\nbecoming the King? Do you know that, Minister?”\\n\\n“If only I had known that I would not have waited till you ask for it, Your\\nHighness. You will have to know it only from the Queen Mother when she\\ncomes here.”\\n\\n“Yes, that is still nagging my mind. Make arrangements to bring the Queen\\nMother immediately. I will remove the block in her mind, however large or\\nhowever complex it may be. Who can we send to bring her? I’ll send my\\ndaughter, Kunthavai. She is the right person. Devi, please bring Kunthavai here\\nimmediately.”\\n\\nThe Empress was listening to the conversation between the Emperor and the\\nChief Minister. But a part of her mind was with the mute queen. When the\\nEmperor asked her to bring Kunthavai she rushed to the ladies chambers. She\\nwas startled to see Kunthavai, Vanathi and Poonkuzhali in a state of shock. The\\nEmpress knew the reason straightaway. Mandhakini was not there.\\n\\nWhen the Empress asked Kunthavai about her, Kunthavai burst out.\\n\\n\\x0c“Amma, you wanted me to beautify the kind lady. But it was the most difficult\\nassignment, Amma. We forced Mandhakini to have a bath which she reluctantly\\ndid. Then we adorned her with new dresses. Vanathi was combing her hair.\\nPoonkuzhali was preparing flowers for her. As I was taking out the jewels for\\nher I heard her shriek. I turned around. Mandhakini Devi was not there. As soon\\nher hair was combed and braided up she freed herself from Vanathi and ran\\naway. We could not see her in any of the rooms. We are still looking out for her.\\n\\nThe Empress smiled benevolently.\\n\\n“Was there a mirror opposite to her?”\\n\\n“Yes, Amma. At some distance from her.”\\n\\n“She must have seen her on the mirror. She must have been overcome by\\nshyness. She must have run to hide herself. Look for her in all the places. She\\nmight have probably gone to the garden attached to the ladies chambers. She is\\nused to scaling walls and going through the windows. Don’t give up.”\\n\\nThey all went to the garden. She was not there. They all became anxious. They\\nfirst thought of informing the King and the Chief Minister. As they were turning\\nto go they heard a loud noise. It appeared as if somebody was hitting a stone\\nwith an iron tool. They now knew that the sound came from the Hall of\\nSculptures. They sent a maid to fetch an oil lamp. And then went into the Hall of\\nSculptures. A strange sight awaited them there.\\n\\nMandhakini now dressed in the best silks of the Palace was wielding a sword\\nwith a long handle. She used the sword to strike the hands of the Demon Ravana\\n\\n\\x0cwho was holding Mount Kailas in his hand in the sculpture. The sculpture was\\nvery strong and hence it did not yield to the blows from the sword. But it\\nappeared that the demon in the sculpture might soon be in danger. Twenty hands\\nof the demon king were bearing the mountain. Even if one or two hands are\\nbroken the entire weight of the mountain would shift to his heads. And the heads\\nmight be shattered with the weight of the mountain. Kunthavai and others\\nentered the hall precisely at this point of time.\\n\\nWhen Mandhakini saw them she dropped the sword and smiled at them.\\nEverybody except Poonkuzhali thought that Mandhakini was after all a crazy\\nwoman. And it was no wonder the Emperor hated her.\\n\\nThe Empress told others in a stern voice:”Girls, let nobody breathe about this\\nincident in the presence of the Emperor.”\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 35 - The Emperor’s Anger\\n\\nAt the time when Mandhakini was discovered in the Hall of Sculptures by the\\nother women a heated argument was going on between the Emperor and the\\nChief Minister.\\n\\n“Your Highness, I did not want to discuss certain things in the presence of\\nwomen. But now a time has come that I can no longer hold them back from you.\\nThe personal body guards of the slain king Veera Pandiyan are roaming around\\nin our country. They are anxiously looking for the right time to fulfil their deadly\\nvow.”\\n\\nThere was a scornful smile on the Emperor’s face.\\n\\n“That is old news, Minister. Pazhuvettaraiyars have strengthened the security\\narrangements for me precisely for that reason.”\\n\\n“My Lord, you know about those crooks. But you may not know that those\\nconspirators are funded from the Chozha Treasury.”\\n\\n“What is this new yarn you are spinning now?”\\n\\n“I have much more wonderful yarn to spin, Your Majesty. The new gold coins\\nfrom Pazhuvettaraiyar’s underground treasury were placed in a heap before those\\nconspirators. Here is a direct eye-witness, my disciple, Azhwarkkadian. He is\\n\\n\\x0cready to lay bare the details if you so wish, Your Highness.”\\n\\n“No need. The Pazhuvettaraiyars have been shedding blood for the Chozha clan\\nfor so many generations. Even if the legendary king Harichandra, known for his\\nhonesty, were to tell me that the Pazhuvettaraiyars are funding those conspirators\\nwho want to kill me, I won’t believe him.”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon, Your Majesty. I am not levelling such a grave charge against\\nthe Pazhuvettaraiyars. Perhaps the gold coins are going to the conspirators\\nwithout their knowledge.”\\n\\n“Impossible, Minister. Can anybody die without the knowledge of Yama, the\\nLord of Death?”\\n\\n“If Yama in his old age had married a young woman even that is possible, Your\\nHighness.”\\n\\n“I also do not like the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar marrying at this age. I have\\nspoken my mind to him on this matter. But that alone is not sufficient to charge\\nhim with sedition. I can’t bear it.”\\n\\n“My Lord, I am not accusing the Pazhuvettaraiyar. I am accusing his young\\nwife.”\\n\\n“I can bear your maligning men but not a hapless woman. Especially one as\\nmiserable as his young wife. It is disgusting, Minister!”\\n\\n\\x0c“However disgusting it may be, I have a duty to disclose certain matters about\\nthe Junior Queen of Pazhuvur. Once I held back the truth. And I have been\\nregretting that decision till this day. You too were angry with me for that a short\\nwhile ago. So I have decided to share with you whatever I know. Please give me\\na patient hearing, Your Highness.”\\n\\nThe Emperor was pleased by the clever words of his wise Minister. He smiled.\\n\\n“You are directing my own words against me? Good. No offence taken. But\\nremember that was purely a personal matter. There is absolutely no relationship\\nbetween the two. Even then I am ready to hear you. Go ahead.”\\n\\n“Nandini Devi walked into the Pazhuvur Palace three years ago as the bride of\\nSenior Pazhuvettaraiyar. Since that date some sorcerers have been coming to the\\nPalace quite frequently. Even the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar knows about it. He too\\nhates those sorcerers. But he could not go against his elder brother.”\\n\\n“Ideal brothers! What affection!”\\n\\n“But, their brotherly love should not harm the country’s interest, Your\\nHighness.”\\n\\n“What harm has happened to the country, Minister? Just because a crazy girl\\nfoolishly believes in sorcery and has invited some sorcerers to do some tricks, do\\nyou think the country’s safety is compromised? Or perhaps do you suggest that\\nthe Junior Queen made me fall ill because of her sorcery?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Your Highness, the Pazhuvur Queen’s visitors are not really sorcerers. I\\nstrongly suspect that they are conspirators in the garb of sorcerers. I suspect that\\nthe country’s treasures are being robbed by them.”\\n\\n“Anybody can cast aspersions on anything. Do you have proof, Minister?”\\n\\n“Oh King of Kings, if only we search Pazhuvettaraiyar’s Palace and the\\nunderground treasury we might get some solid proof.”\\n\\n“Nobody has suggested anything more hateful than that. Chief Minister\\nAniruddha Brahmarayar, listen. You are just a friend. And that too only to me.\\nBut Pazhuvettaraiyar is the best friend of three generations of Chozha Kings. He\\nis like an iron shield to the whole clan. He is like the destructive Vajrayutha of\\nthe chief of gods to the enemies of Chozha kingdom. How can I search the\\nPalace belonging to a man of such a stature? I will rather believe that my wife is\\ntrying to poison me than believing that the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar is harbouring\\ncriminals in his palace.”\\n\\n“Your Highness, Pazhuvettaraiyar is innocent. Blinded my infatuation for his\\nyoung wife he does not know what is happening right under his nose. Without\\nhis knowledge his Palace has become a sanctuary for the conspirators. I have\\ngrounds to believe that the Junior Queen is part of the gang.”\\n\\n“What further charges are you going to level against that innocent girl?”\\n\\n“A few days ago a coronation ceremony was performed at the Prithvipathi’s War\\n\\n\\x0cMemorial in the forest of Thiruppurambayam. A five year old boy was made to\\nsit on a throne and was crowned as a Pandya King. Those who took part in this\\nceremony vowed to destroy the Chozha clan without a trace.”\\n\\n“Chief Minister, do you by any chance want to frighten me with this piece of\\ninformation? Do you expect me to shake in fear?”\\n\\n“Not at all, Your Highness. I never gave a damn to that mockery. But I just\\nwanted to say that the Pazhuvur Queen was one among those who vowed to\\ndestroy the Chozha clan.”\\n\\n“Now tell me which super-intelligent guy saw that ceremony and shared that\\ninformation with you. Perhaps this disciple of yours?”\\n\\n“No, Your Highness. Azhwarkkadian went there after the ceremony was over.\\nThe one who saw it was the warrior of the Vana clan, Vandhiya Thevan.”\\n\\n“You mean the spy who came here once and then ran away?”\\n\\n“He is not a spy, Your Highness. He is the best friend of your dear son, Adithya\\nKarikalan.”\\n\\n“Karikalan has so many friends like him. And each friend will have his own way\\nof seeing things. Let us assume what this man told you to be true. But we cannot\\ndo anything about it. Pazhuvettaraiyar is not in station. The Junior Queen also is\\nnot there. Let us discuss this issue after they come back. But Minister, after\\n\\n\\x0chearing about the Pazhuvur Queen I am curious to see her.\\n\\n“When Pazhuvettaraiyar told me that he had married a young girl I was so\\ndisgusted with him that I forbade him from bringing his young wife in my\\npresence. Perhaps she hates me for that. As soon as Pazhuvettaraiyar comes back\\nI will ask him to bring his wife so that her hard feelings towards me are\\nremoved.”\\n\\n“A very good idea, Your Highness. I was about to suggest that. You need to\\npacify her for other important reasons as well. I want your permission to let the\\nLankan Queen stay in our Palace till the Pazhuvur Queen comes back.”\\n\\n“Oh, you have crowned her the Lankan Queen? Have your way. Let her stay\\nhere. But tell me the connection between her and the Pazhuvur Queen.”\\n\\n“That is precisely what we should find out, my Lord. If the two women meet\\nface to face we will know the connection, Your Highness. That might even\\nsoften Nandini’s heart and remove the enmity she has for the Chozha clan.”\\n\\n“Chief Minister, I am surprised that you are so overly concerned with a woman’s\\nenmity.”\\n\\n“I have strong reasons, Your Highness. But I am afraid whether it will be proper\\nto disclose them now.”\\n\\n“If you don’t tell me then nobody else will. Please go ahead.”\\n\\n\\x0cThe Chief Minister thought for a while and then started to talk.\\n\\n“Your Highness, what I am about to say is a little complex. I don’t think you’d\\nlike to hear this. But I beg of you, Your Highness, please listen to me.\\nWhosoever has seen Nandini and Mandhakini Devi are surprised by the striking\\nresemblance they bear to each other.”\\n\\n“There are so many things like that in the world. Haven’t we seen a tree which\\nexactly resembles another? Likewise there is a mad woman who closely\\nresembles another. What is the big deal in that?”\\n\\n“But a tree does not act like another. A mad woman does not act like the ghost of\\nanother mad woman and torment the Emperor of a Kingdom.”\\n\\n“What are you insinuating, Chief Minister?”\\n\\n“You have been lamenting that Mandhakini’s spirit has been haunting you in the\\nnights… “\\n\\n“Oh do you mean to say that her spirit did not come and that she came herself.”\\n\\n“No, Your Highness. Nandini acted like Mandhakini’s ghost and tortured you.”\\n\\n\\x0cThe Emperor sat up on his bed. His eyes went red and his body shook in anger.\\n\\n“If what you say is true then I will wring the neck of that devil with my own\\nhands and... “\\n\\nThe Chief Minister did not let him complete the sentence.\\n\\n“Please, Your Highness. Please don’t take such vows.”\\n\\n“Why? Why are you soft towards her? The damned lady gave me real hell. No\\npunishment can be harsh for what she did to me.” The Emperor was furious.\\n\\n“What if the tormentor happens to be a close relative... perhaps your own\\ndaughter...? “\\n\\n“Chief Minister, are you in your senses or what?”\\n\\n“I have tested your patience, Your Highness. Please give a suitable punishment\\nfor me. But don’t ever think of punishing Nandini Devi. She is not just the young\\nwife of Pazhuvettaraiyar. She is the daughter of the Emperor of the Three Words,\\nthe Great Sundara Chozhan. Who in the world has the right to punish her, Your\\nHighness?”\\n\\nThe Emperor was stunned. He was staring at the Minister for a while. Then he\\nburst out into laughter.\\n\\n\\x0c“Your Highness today is a red letter day in my life, for I have seen you laughing\\ntwice.”\\n\\n“Chief Minister, I thought there is only one madcap in this Palace. I now realise\\nthat you are a greater lunatic than her. The only difference between you two is\\nthat she cannot talk while you can.”\\n\\nThe Emperor started to laugh again.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 36 - Late In The Night\\n\\nThe Emperor was still laughing when the women entered his chambers. First\\ncame the Empress. She was followed by Mandhakini Devi held on two sides by\\nPrincess Kunthavai and Vanathi. They were followed by Poonkuzhali and a\\nmaid. They came in a formation. The women’s face brightened on hearing the\\nEmperor’s laugh.\\n\\nMandhakini lifted her face to see the Emperor and then looked down. The efforts\\nto beautify her had reached a perfectly logical conclusion. Kunthavai was\\ncelebrated as the best beautician in the Kingdom in those days. And that made\\nmany Chieftains in the Chozha Kingdom send their daughters to the Emperor’s\\npalace to learn the art from Kunthavai. She had lavished all her skills on the\\nMute Queen.\\n\\nBy a strange intuition she had done Mandhakini’s hair like that of the legendary\\nwoman-saint, Andal. And this made the Mute Queen strongly resemble Nandini.\\nAs soon as Mandhakini’s hair was done every woman recognised the striking\\nresemblance between her and Nandini.\\n\\nUnlike other women of her age Mandhakini had not adopted a sedentary life\\nstyle. She had been roaming in the forest all her life and this fact substantially\\nreduced the effect of the differences in age between the two women. Mandhakini\\nshould be older than Nandini by at least twenty five years. But she looked much\\nyounger than her age. The women felt proud in presenting Mandhakini to the\\nKing. And every woman had her own reasons.\\n\\nAt that time in history it had been the practice of the Emperors and Chieftains of\\n\\n\\x0cTamilnadu to have many wives. Wars were the order of the day. The young\\nPrinces remained at the battle-front most of the time risking their precious lives.\\nThe King married many women in his anxiety to leave an offspring. The Queen,\\nor the first wife, had to be adept in the art of being friends with her rivals - her\\nhusband’s other wives. Absence of jealousy over the other women and the\\nability to move with them as close friends were prized traits of an Empress. For\\nthe reigning Empress, Mandhakini’s arrival afforded the best opportunity to put\\nthat quality to the test. She came out in flying colours.\\n\\nFor Kunthavai it was the finest expression of her art. She was proud. For hadn’t\\nshe changed the crazy looking forest woman into a beauty queen within a matter\\nof hours?\\n\\nPoonkuzhali was dancing on Cloud Nine seeing the respect and hospitality\\nshown to her aunt. Wasn’t she treated on par with the reigning queen? She had\\nalways thought that the women in the Palace would be vain and arrogant. But\\ncontrary to her thoughts the women in the palace were soft, kind, courteous,\\nconsiderate and even loving. Poonkuzhali was happy beyond words. She was\\nrelieved that her aunt had finally found her home.\\n\\nThe Emperor was still laughing when a procession of happy and proud women\\nentered his chambers. He glanced at the women. Mandhakini’s appearance jolted\\nhim out of his laughter. It appeared as if he could not believe his own eyes. He\\nclosed his eyes with his hands and then opened again to take another look.\\n\\nThe Chief Minister’s words were still lingering in his mind. The strong\\nresemblance between the figure that tortured him in the nights and the woman\\nstanding before him now was quite evident. At the same time he was sharp\\nenough to notice a few differences. He now wanted to explore the mystery\\nfurther and know the full truth. However his hatred towards the mute queen\\nremained undiminished. But he decided to keep the hatred to himself for the time\\nbeing.\\n\\n\\x0cHe addressed the Chief Minister:\\n\\n“Minister, a few minutes ago I called you crazy. Now it seems that I am the\\ncraziest of all. From now on in addition to the Doctor, send in a sorcerer too\\nevery day. I won’t mind even if you send the same sorcerer who comes to see the\\nJunior Queen of Pazhuvur.”\\n\\nThe Chief Minister was shocked. He muttered a silent prayer - ‘Let not any of\\nthose vile sorcerers come a mile near the Emperor.’\\n\\n“Your Highness, why do we need a sorcerer? Why do we need sorcery at all\\nwhen we have the greatest of sorcery in our hands - I mean my Lord’s name?\\nThe sacred name of Sriman Narayana.”\\n\\nKunthavai came forward to talk to her father.\\n\\n“Father, did you send for me? Do you want me to go to Pazhaiyaarai? Father,\\nwill you please let all of us women go together?”\\n\\nThe Emperor did not respond to her daughter’s pleas. Instead he spoke to the\\nChief Minister:\\n\\n“Minister, I have changed my mind. These girls look so enthusiastic for some\\nstrange reason. Looks like they are celebrating the homecoming of a bride. I\\ndon’t want to spoil their party. As you advised me a short while ago, let all these\\n\\n\\x0cwomen stay in the Palace. The Queen Mother Sembian Madevi has very high\\nregards for you. Why don’t you take upon yourself the task of bringing her\\nhere? Send your disciple to Nagapattinam. I’ll send word to the Junior\\nPazhuvettaraiyar to bring the Senior and his wife to see me as soon as they\\nreturn to their base.”\\n\\n“As you please, Your Highness. But it may take some time for them to reach\\nhere. Thanks to the violent storm we had yesterday all our rivers are in spate.”\\n\\n“No issues, Minister. I have been waiting for so many days. No harm in waiting\\nfor a few days more. And if you make arrangements to bring Karikalan as well\\nwe can resolve all the burning issues. And if he still refuses to come then I have\\nno other option than undertaking a painful journey to see him. But let us discuss\\nthat later. I want you to go to Pazhaiyaarai tomorrow and bring the Queen\\nMother here as early as possible. When you travel please do have an eye on the\\ndamages caused by the storm. Find out whether any further relief measures are\\nnecessary. We are focussing too much on the family issues and have forgotten\\nour primary duty - the welfare of our people.”\\n\\n“No, my Lord. I have not forgotten that. Relief work is in full swing. Your\\nHighness need not worry about it.”\\n\\nThe Chief Minister took leave of him.\\n\\nThe Emperor had never felt so peaceful and relaxed in the recent past. The news\\nthat Mandhakini had not after all died had lifted a huge burden off his heart. The\\nnews that Prince Arulmozhi was safe in Nagapattinam deepened his sense of\\npeace and well-being. The Choodamani Monastery in Nagapattinam was housed\\nin one of the strongest buildings and hence no one living in the monastery was\\nlikely to be affected by the previous day’s storm. He no longer worried for the\\n\\n\\x0csafety of his darling son, Arulmozhi. He felt rather strange when he ruminated\\non the words of the Chief Minister that the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur might\\nprobably be his daughter through Mandhakini. This made him smile quite often.\\n\\nHe was teasing the women in his room. He praised his daughter’s skills in\\nbeautifying a woman.\\n\\n“Oh My God! Dear, you have made a barbaric creature look like the wife of the\\nChief of Gods, the Indrani. But tell me do you need to show your skills on an old\\nwoman like her? You should show them on a young and beautiful creature like\\nthis Vanathi.”\\n\\nThen he sought for details about Arulmozhivarman from Poonkuzhali.\\nPoonkuzhali shared whatever she knew eagerly with the Emperor.\\n\\nAt the end of it she prayed to the King.\\n\\n“My Lord, please allow me to return to Kodikkarai tomorrow morning. I need\\nnot worry about my aunt anymore.”\\n\\n“But what about your another aunt’s son who is down with fever? Should you\\nnot be concerned about him? Don’t be in a hurry. Stay here for a few days.”\\n\\nPoonkuzhali remained silent.\\n\\n\\x0cThe Emperor slept well that night. He did not have many dreams. And whatever\\ndreams he had were good. The women of the Palace who slept in the next room\\nalso had a peaceful sleep- except Mandhakini. She was restless. The day’s events\\ndisturbed her a lot and did not let her sleep. Her thoughts hovered around the\\nunderground treasury and the subterranean passage. She had planned to break\\nthe hands of Ravana statue. That would have kind of closed the underground\\npassage. But the other women did not let her execute her plan. That made her\\nrestless. She could not sleep with the Emperor being exposed to a grave risk. She\\nwas staring at the decorated ceiling for a long time.\\n\\nIt was almost three in the morning. She saw a figure through the window that\\nopened to the terrace. She saw a scary face peeping through the window. She\\nwas almost sure of the identity of that person. She woke up shocked. She saw the\\nwindow again. The face was not there. She got up and walked up to the entrance\\nof the next room. The door was open. She could see that the Emperor was in\\ndeep, peaceful sleep. She went into the room to have a look at the windows. She\\ndid not see anything.\\n\\nShe came back. She touched Poonkuzhali. Poonkuzhali did not move. She shook\\nher. Poonkuzhali woke up from a deep slumber. She was shocked on seeing the\\nexpression in Mandhakini’s face. Mandhakini signalled her to follow her.\\nPoonkuzhali who loved her aunt and had high regards for her intuitive abilities\\nfollowed her.\\n\\nMandhakini walked towards the Hall of Sculptures. She took an oil lamp on the\\nway. Poonkuzhali was a little worried about her aunt’s behaviour. Was she going\\nto try to break the Ravana statue again? But then the sound was sure to wake up\\nothers. And if they did it would be proved beyond doubt that her aunt had after\\nall lost her mind.\\n\\nPoonkuzhali decided to stop her aunt. And if she went overboard Poonkuzhali\\nwould snatch the hammer from her aunt’s hand. She followed her aunt into the\\n\\n\\x0cHall.\\n\\nWhat was that? She sensed movement in one of the heads of the ten-headed\\ndemon. No, it was not the head of the statue. A human head had appeared in the\\nmiddle of the Kailash Mountain. And the human head vanished at once. Was it\\nreal? Or an illusion? Or a hallucination caused by her not fully awake mind? Or\\nwas it the dance of the shadows of the sculptures caused by the light coming\\nfrom the oil lamp?\\n\\nPerhaps Mandhakini too saw the face. She went near the Ravana statue. Thank\\nGod she did not pay attention to the sword lying nearby. There was a dark space\\nbetween the Ravana’s heads and hands and the Kailash Mountain. Mandhakini\\nlifted the lamp to illuminate the space. There was a gaping hole there.\\nPoonkuzhali’s earlier guess had been proved right. That was an exit for a secret\\npassage. It had been so cleverly hidden from view. Mandhakini tried to close that\\nexit earlier. But others could not understand her actions and inwardly labelled\\nher a mad woman. And they did not let her block the passage.\\n\\nPoonkuzhali was absorbed in her thoughts when the mute queen asked her to\\nfollow her. She got into the small hole and started moving ahead. First her aunt’s\\nbody disappeared and then her head and finally the lamp she was carrying aloft.\\nOnly a faint light coming from the lamp showed the way. Poonkuzhali\\nconstricted her body to squeeze herself into the small passage. A few moments\\nlater Poonkuzhali also disappeared. The light of the lamp faded out. The Hall of\\nSculptures was plunged into darkness once again.\\n\\nThe Empress, Kunthavai and Vanathi woke up early in the morning and were\\nshocked to see that Mandhakini and Poonkuzhali were not in the places they\\nslept. They searched for them throughout the Palace, the adjoining garden and\\neven in the Hall of Sculptures. They were not to be found. How could they have\\nvanished from the highly guarded Palace complex was a mystery for the women\\nof the Royal household.\\n\\n\\x0cWhen the Emperor came to know of this at first he was a little worried. Then he\\ntold in a loud voice as if to console himself.\\n\\n“Good riddance. The crazy women have gone. That is important. How they\\nvanished is not.”\\n\\nEven as he spoke those words a strange fear gripped his mind.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 37 - Kadambur Agitated\\n\\nEver since Adithya Karikalan arrived at the Kadambur Palace the residents and\\nthe guests felt like they were treading on a bed of thorns and walking over fire.\\nNo one could guess what kind of missiles would burst forth from the Prince’s\\ntongue.\\n\\nThe Crown Prince often insinuated about the conspiracy to enthrone\\nMadhuranthakan. That made others squirm in embarrassment. The\\nPazhuvettaraiyar could not bear the insults hurled at him. At one point he even\\nadvised Sambuvaraiyar that they should openly tell the Crown Prince about the\\nChieftains’ low opinion about him. Sambuvaraiyar was against it.\\n\\n“Please be patient. He is our guest now. And he is a ruffian. What if our words\\nmisfire and we get caught in complications? Let’s bide our time.”\\n\\nOf course Sambuvaraiyar also wanted to tell the Crown Prince that the\\nChieftains were not so enthusiastic in his becoming a King.\\n\\nBut he was not in a hurry. He was waiting for the right moment.\\n\\nThe Crown Prince himself gifted the right moment to the two old men. One day\\nwhile in the presence of all the guests he blurted out:\\n\\n“I want to seek the advice of my Pazhuvur Pattan (Grandfather) and Kadambur\\n\\n\\x0cMaman (Uncle). That is the reason I came to Kadambur. Three years ago my\\nfather made me the Crown Prince. You all supported his decision. But later, it\\nseems, that the Emperor has changed his mind. I hear that he wants to crown\\nMadhuranthakan. He has been inviting me to come to Thanjavur again and\\nagain.\\n\\nOn my part I have been avoiding meeting the Emperor. Why should I go? Why\\nshould I meet him and openly disobey him? Don’t you think it is prudent to\\navoid meeting him? My dear Pazhuvur Patta, and you, Kadambur Mama you are\\ngreat men of age and wisdom. You know the ways of the world. You know what\\nis fair and what is not. You tell me, is it fair on the part of my father to ask me to\\ngive up the Crown? And that too after so many years? And is it a crime to turn\\ndown such an unfair request?”\\n\\nEveryone was shocked to hear the exceedingly firm words of the Crown Prince.\\n\\nSenior Pazhuvettaraiyar cleared his throat and bought some time by throwing\\nanother question at the Prince.\\n\\n“My Lord, I am sure you would have discussed this with your grandfather. What\\nis Thirukkovalur Malaiyaman’s take on this issue?”\\n\\n“Aha! You all know the old lion! Do you think he will let his grandson give up\\nhis throne to somebody else? He’d rather kill me and my mother, his own\\ndaughter. Do you know that he has started gathering an army already? He says\\nthat he will wage a war to protect his grandson’s right to the throne. But I am not\\ngoing to listen to him. I’ll rather go by your advice.”\\n\\n\\x0cKarikalan talked like a very soft and sensitive person now.\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar was disappointed.\\n\\n“We are not like Malaiyaman. We will never instigate the son to rise against his\\nown father. We are bound by honour and duty to obey the command of the\\nEmperor, whatever it may be. But as seniors who have been serving the country\\nfor many generations we have the right to tell what is right in this case. We can’t\\nsay that the Emperor’s request is completely baseless. We cannot deny\\nMadhuranthakan’s right to the Chozha Throne.\\n\\n“Since you have asked very specifically we don’t want to hide anything. We’ll\\ntell you what we think. We’ll leave the final decision to you.\\n\\nWe think that letting this debate continue any further will harm the interests of\\nthe country. It is better that we arrive at some sort of consensus to avoid\\nconflicts. In the olden days the Chozha Kingdom was small and was confined\\nbetween the two Vellaru Rivers. Today it is vast and is spread all over from\\nKanyakumari to the banks of River Krishna. Even if we divide the Kingdom into\\ntwo, each half will be a large Kingdom in its own merit. That way it will be fair\\nto give the area south of River Coleroon to Madhuranthakan and the area north\\nof Coleroon to you, my Lord. This is our compromise formula. If you agree to\\nthis arrangement we will go ahead with partition. It will be my personal\\nresponsibility to convince the Emperor in this regard.”\\n\\nAdithya Karikalan’s noisy laugh caused waves of fury to rise in\\nPazhuvettaraiyar’s stomach.\\n\\n\\x0c“Patta, You want to divide the Chozha Kingdom into two so that the\\nPazhuvettaraiyars can rule the Southern Part and the Sambuvaraiyars, the\\nNorthern one. It is a good compromise formula. After all your families have\\nbeen serving the Kingdom since the time of my great grandfather. And this is a\\nfair reward for your services.\\n\\n“But I do not want to divide the Kingdom. Not at all. Dividing the Kingdom and\\nsharing it between two claimants is like sharing one’s wife with others. You old\\nmen may not mind that kind of a sharing arrangement. But I am against it.”\\n\\nSparks flew in Pazhuvettaraiyar’s eyes. He stood up. He was ready to unsheathe\\nhis sword.\\n\\n“Patta, why do you want to quit now? Listen to me. Let me tell you my plan. I\\nhate dividing this great Kingdom. My ancestors and yours struggled for more\\nthan five generations, sacrificed the lives of so many warriors, to consolidate the\\nKingdom and grow it to this size. It is a grave sin to make it small once again by\\ndividing it within the family. Our ancestors like Rajadithya, who are living in\\nheaven, will curse our families. So drop the idea.\\n\\nI am ready to give up the entire Kingdom in favour of Madhuranthakan. In a way\\nit is fair. After all who is Madhuranthakan? He is my grandfather’s brother’s son.\\nIn fact he should have been crowned the King in the place of my father. But\\nthanks to Emperor Paranthaka, my father ascended the throne. That’s a mistake\\nand let the same mistake not happen again.\\n\\nThough I have every right to claim the throne under the “son after his father”\\nrule, I’ll give up my claim in favour of Madhuranthakan. I’ll do that on one\\ncondition. I want an army of three hundred thousand men to invade north. I want\\nyou to give me the arms, weapons and other necessary things for the army. I also\\n\\n\\x0cwant you to give food for one year for the army. I also want three hundred ships\\nthat are seaworthy. I’ll create a Navy and make Parthibendran the Chief of Navy.\\nI’ll make him sail along the coast while I’ll be invading the territories with the\\narmy by land. Parthibendran and I will meet at the estuary of Ganges River.\\nThen we will join forces and go further north. One of my forbears, my\\nnamesake, Karikal Valavan, went up the Himalayas and hoisted the Tiger Flag in\\nthe one of the peaks the mountain range. The poets of our country eulogize him\\nfor this achievement. What my ancestor did, I’ll do again. With the help of my\\nsword, with the help of my soldiers I’ll become the Emperor of the territory\\nnorth of River Krishna.\\n\\nAnd if I die in war I’ll ascend that heaven reserved for the bravest of brave for I\\nwould have died in the cause of establishing my Kingdom.\\n\\nPazhuvur Patta! Kadambur Mama! What do you say? Are you ready to accept\\nmy condition?”\\n\\nKarikalan paused after delivering a majestic speech.\\n\\nThe two old men were shocked. Pazhuvettaraiyar’s voice was shaken.\\n\\n“My Lord, who are we to accept your condition? What right do we have? The\\nEmperor alone has to decide. “\\n\\nKarikalan was furious. He thundered to the old man:\\n\\n\\x0c“Patta, how long are you going to deceive us in the name of the Emperor? You\\ncan deceive anyone; but not me. You have imprisoned my father in his own\\npalace. You have made him a puppet who dances to your tune. Do you think I\\ndon’t know that? Can anybody see my father without the permission of your\\nbrother Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar? My father issued orders to arrest my brother in\\nLanka. Was it because he liked to do that? No, you forced him. Do you think any\\nfather will have the heart to have his darling son arrested? Do you think any\\nfather will order the arrest his own son, who is of one of the greatest warriors of\\nour times and the darling of the people? The people of Chozha Kingdom are\\noutraged because you arrested the Prince, tortured and killed him by drowning.\\nPeople are furious over you, Patta.”\\n\\n“Prince, who told you that? Who levelled that grossly baseless charge against\\nme? Tell me, Prince. I’ll slit open their mouths and cut their tongues. And then\\nslaughter them.”\\n\\n“If it is just one person you can do whatever you want. Thousands, why, lakhs\\nand lakhs of people are accusing you. And if you want to punish them all the\\nChozha Kingdom will become a large cremation ground. And if it happened it\\nwill be ideal for Madhuranthakan to rule over the country. For he is Lord Shiva’s\\ndevotee. And we know that the Lord loves to dance in cemeteries and cremation\\ngrounds. But, Patta, I don’t believe their words. People are fools. If one man says\\nsomething everybody else will repeat it without reflecting on it. You and your\\nancestors have been helping the Chozha clan for generations. I am sure you\\nwould not have done such a heinous act. If Arulmozhi had drowned in the sea it\\nshould be because of his destiny. Perhaps he did so to mock at the astrologers\\nand palmists who have been repeating like a parrot that he was born to rule over\\nthe three worlds.\\n\\n“You may be the greatest of warriors. Even then you cannot create a storm in the\\nmiddle of the sea or make lightning strike the sails of his boat. That could be\\nhandiwork of the sorcerers of Pandya Kingdom. But you are no way responsible\\nfor that calamity. Nor are you responsible for Arulmozhi’s death.\\n\\n\\x0cBut don’t ever say “I’ll have to consult the Emperor” again. Then you will even\\nsay, “I’ll have to consult the Chief Minister.” The Emperor and Chief Minister\\nsimply bear their respective titles. They cannot do anything without consulting\\nyou.\\n\\nOh yes, you can say, “I’ll consult your grandmother, Nandini Devi.” That will be\\nreasonable.”\\n\\nKandhanmaran intervened.\\n\\n“My Lord, you are. ... He is our guest now.... “He was shaken. He spoke out\\naloud. But the words were not coherent.\\n\\nKarikalan spat fire.\\n\\n“Kandhanmaran, is this your house? I forgot. I even forgot the fact that you are a\\ndescendant of the great warrior, Ori of Kollimalai. In your house and that too in\\nyour presence, I need to have some kind of fear and restraint. Right?\\n\\nBut tell me, what did I say wrong? What did I do to your guests? Why are you\\ntrembling now? Perhaps you are afflicted with that viral fever which is rampant\\nin Srilanka. But you have never been to Lanka. How did you get that?”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan stood up.\\n\\n\\x0c“My Lord, Kandhanmaran does not have any fever. He is upset because you\\ncalled the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur, grandmother.”\\n\\nKandhanmaran glared at Vandhiya Thevan with hostile fury in his eyes. He tried\\nto unsheathe his sword. Parthibendran held his hand and made him sit down. He\\nwhispered something in his ears.\\n\\nKandhanmaran was pacified. But he was still trembling. Karikalan laughed at\\nhim before turning to Pazhuvettaraiyar.\\n\\n“Patta, young men will be like that. At times they will be out of our control.\\nIgnore them. In a way you are my grandfather. Then will not the Junior Queen\\nbe my grandmother? I am sure you won’t mind my calling her grandmother. I am\\nsure she won’t mind it. I am surprised why these boys are upset about it? Ok, let\\nit go. I have digressed from the main issue.\\n\\nI request you not to shift the burden to my father, the Emperor. If you agree he\\ntoo will agree to my plan. After all the country’s treasury is under your control.\\nAnd if I announce that I am going to invade north, not just three hundred\\nthousand, but three million soldiers will volunteer to join my army. Getting me\\nthree hundred ships is not a big deal for you. But first you should agree to my\\nplan. And make Madhuranthakan agree. That is all. What do you say?”\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar was shaken. He was groping for words. At last he cleared his\\nthroat and spoke in a trembling voice.\\n\\n\\x0c“My Lord, I might agree to your strange request. But don’t you think that\\nMadhuranthakan also should agree? Again, how can you go on your great\\nexpedition without taking leave of the Emperor? So I suggest that we all go to\\nThanjavur.”\\n\\n“I can’t do that, Patta. What if my father orders me to do something else? Then I\\ncan’t go against him. My mother, Malaiyaman’s daughter and my sister,\\nKunthavai may not like my decision of abdicating the throne and going on an\\nexpedition. It’ll be very difficult for me to go against their wishes. Patta, this\\nmatter has to be decided here in this Kadambur Palace.\\n\\n“I suggest that you go to Thanjavur and bring Madhuranthakan here. Let me\\nexplain my stand and help him come to a decision. We will then inform my\\nfather. You start making arrangements for my expedition. Once the army, the\\nships and everything is ready I’ll come to Thanjavur to take leave of my parents.\\nAlternatively, let Madhuranthakan be crowned now itself. And then let my\\nparents come to Kancheepuram. I’ll make them stay in the golden palace built by\\nme. I’ll stay with them for a few days before leaving north.”\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar looked at Sambuvaraiyar who was looking at the ceiling.\\nPazhuvettaraiyar knew that he would not get any help from his host. He spoke in\\na very soft voice:\\n\\n“How can I go against your orders, my Lord?”\\n\\n“Don’t say ‘orders’ Patta. You have been serving the nation for decades. Your\\nhair has gone grey in service to the country. How can a small boy like me order\\nyou around? Tell me you’ll grant my prayer, Patta.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Okay, let it be so.” Pazhuvettaraiyar cleared his throat.\\n\\n“Thank you very much, Patta. Please make arrangements for your journey. Fast!\\nLet Madhuranthakan come on an elephant. Or he can ride on a golden chariot.\\nLet him not come in the closed palanquin of the Junior Queen.”\\n\\nKarikalan laughed.\\n\\nHe then turned to Kandhanmaran and others.\\n\\n“Kandhanmaran, you are very fortunate. More guests are coming here.\\nMadhuranthakan who is going to succeed Sundara Chozhan as the Emperor of\\nChozha Kingdom is going to be your guest. He may even bring with him his\\nwife, the would-be Queen of the Nation, the daughter of Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar.\\nKadambur Palace will wear a festive look. Let Pazhuvettaraiyar leave for\\nThanjavur. Come, let us go for hunting. Once I was an expert archer. People used\\nto say, “After the legendary Arjuna the next best is our Adithya Karikalan.” But I\\nhave not touched my bow for the last three years. I will have to train myself\\nagain. I will need a lot of practice. Parthibendra, Vandhiya Theva! Come let’s go.\\nLet’s start now. Where shall we go? To Kollimalai Forest?”\\n\\nSambuvarayar who never took part in the conversation so far ventured to speak.\\n\\n“My Lord, Kollimalai forest is far away. You need not go that far. There is a\\ndense forest in the Western banks of Veeranarayana Lake. It is known as\\n“Dhandakaranyam”. There are a lot of wild animals in that forest. The animals\\nwe hunted in that forest are there in our Hunters’ Hall. If you leave early in the\\nmorning you can come home by night.”\\n\\n\\x0c“As you please, Sir. As long as I am your guest in this palace your word is the\\nlay. Can we take your daughter Manimekalai with us? She is a good\\nconversationalist and is adept in creating a joyful atmosphere.”\\n\\n“I don’t have any objection, my Lord. Let’s find out if Manimekalai is\\ninterested.”\\n\\nKandhanmaran intervened.\\n\\n“Why do we need women when we go on hunting? That will be a headache for\\nus. We’ll spend most of the time worried about the safety of the women. We\\ncan’t focus on hunting. If we take Manimekalai out for hunting then the Junior\\nQueen of Pazhuvur will be left alone without any company.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes. Kandhanmaran is always worried about Pazhuvur Patti. Coming to\\nthink of it there is another problem in taking Manimekalai for hunting. The way\\nshe jumps and runs, people may mistake her for a deer and shoot arrows. Let the\\nwomen stay in the Palace. We shall go for hunting. We need to leave very early\\nin the morning. I presume we have that Kuravaikoothu entertainment in the\\nevening. Let us see that it ends early so that we can retire early. Only then will be\\nable to get up early in the morning. Send word to the hunters right now.\\nVandhiya Theva, come let’s go to our room.”\\n\\nThe Crown Prince held Vandhiya Thevan’s hand and walked out of the hall.\\nKandhanmaran and Parthibendran were burning in jealousy.\\n\\n\\x0cSambuvaraiyar went away to issue orders to the hunters. The Senior\\nPazhuvettaraiyar went in search of Nandini.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 38 - Nandini Refused\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar was excited over the latest developments. He wanted to share\\nhis excitement with Nandini. He almost ran towards Nandini’s chambers.\\n\\nHe had come to Kadambur with a mission. Till that point of time his mission\\nwas a failure. He had thought naively that if only he could manage to bring\\nAdithya Karikalan, who was after all a small boy, to Kadambur he could make\\nhim dance to his tunes - either by instilling fear or by implanting greed. He\\nbelieved that the Crown Prince was bound to act as dictated by him and\\nSambuvaraiyar.\\n\\nHe knew the dangers of making Madhuranthakan the king of the whole Chozha\\nKingdom. The move will be vehemently opposed by Malaiyaman from the\\nNorth and the Kodumbalur Chieftain from the South. And if a great warrior like\\nKarikalan joined hands, the result would be a disastrous civil war. No one could\\npredict the outcome of that war. A majority of people would naturally support\\nthe sons of the reigning Emperor. Even Madhuranthakan’s own mother, the\\nQueen Mother Sembian Madevi, would work against her son.\\n\\nIt was not possible to take part in the war just with the support of Kalamukas.\\nThere was likely to be a large scale civil mutiny in the Pandya territory, in the\\nChera territory and in the provinces north of Paalaru River. So the best way out\\nwas to make Madhuranthakan the king of one half of the Kingdom, especially\\nthe southern half with Thanjavur as its capital. And later the Pazhuvettaraiyars\\nwould gather enough strength and annex the remaining portion of the Kingdom.\\nOnce Madhuranthakan was crowned the King it would be easy to destroy the\\npowers of Kodumbalur Chieftain later. Then one could turn north and even crush\\nthe forces of Malaiyaman. Karikalan was an over-sensitive, short-tempered,\\nruffian. Given his nature he was likely to get himself involved in some pointless\\n\\n\\x0caffair and might even lose his life. If that happened all the problems of\\nPazhuvettaraiyar would be solved. It would be a matter of mere political\\nprocedure to annex the headless state.\\n\\nAll these points emerged in the discussion Pazhuvettaraiyar had with his young\\nwife Nandini. It was Nandini who planted the idea of partition in his mind and\\nurged him to present the compromise formula. Pazhuvettaraiyar was convinced\\nabout her plan and only then did he decide to go to Kadambur. And requested the\\nCrown Prince to come.\\n\\nBut all his hopes were belied. Nothing happened as planned. He thought that\\nKarikalan would show reverence to the old men and that he and Sambuvaraiyar\\nwould use that as an advantage to shove their partition plan down his throat. But\\nthat never happened. Karikalan virtually humiliated the two grand old men of the\\nChozha Kingdom. He barked orders to them. He advised them on many issues.\\nHe asserted himself and always gained an upper hand in any discussion they had\\nwith him. He never listened to them.\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar could not bear his satirical remarks, his double-meaning words\\nand the insults directly hurled at him. Karikalan insisted on calling him an old\\nman; in fact he addressed him only as Patta, grandfather. Nandini who was\\nyounger than Karikalan was referred to as Paati, the grandmother. Technically no\\none could find fault with the Prince. That was a family tradition. But to\\nPazhuvettaraiyar even the way Karikalan addressed him and his young wife\\nappeared as poisoned arrows directed towards his chest.\\n\\nAs if to add fuel to fire even Sambuvaraiyar’s behaviour was not up to the mark.\\nInstead of standing up for Pazhuvettaraiyar and insisting on Karikalan to behave\\nhimself, Sambuvaraiyar was a silent spectator most of the time. He spoke\\nhesitantly and it was mostly to adhere to the protocol as a host. Perhaps he was a\\nlittle overcautious to avoid any untoward event when the Crown Prince was a\\nguest in his Palace.\\n\\n\\x0cPazhuvettaraiyar hated Sambuvaraiyar’s diplomatic behaviour.\\n\\nBut Adithya Karikalan’s compromise formula changed everything.\\nPazhuvettaraiyar regained the lost enthusiasm.\\n\\nAt the same time he did not know to what extent he can rely on Karikalan’s\\nwords. It was difficult whether the Crown Prince was sincere. Did the Prince\\nspeak what was in his heart? Or did he hide his real feelings and uttered\\nsomething to please him? He could never know. Perhaps the Crown Prince\\nmight have said all those things to test waters. Or perhaps the Prince had laid a\\nbait to bring Madhuranthakan to Kadambur. Who knows, Madhuranthakan\\nmight even be trapped and killed here in Kadambur. The Crown Prince might\\nhave even asked his grandfather Malaiyaman to invade Kadambur and hold the\\nPalace under siege after Madhuranthakan came.\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar did not want to take that kind of a risk. Bringing\\nMadhuranthakan here would be worse than putting all his eggs in one basket.\\nThe best way out was to go to Thanjavur and consult his brother the Junior\\nPazhuvettaraiyar. The Junior was an excellent strategist. And the Junior can be\\nasked to bring a huge army which should be waiting at the banks of Coleroon for\\nany contingency. But irrespective of the decision he took there was no point in\\nletting Nandini stay in that Palace. She would be insulted by these fools. Now\\nthere was an opportunity to take her back and leave her in Thanjavur. Why\\nshould he miss this god-given chance?\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar was smiling when reached the chambers of Nandini. When he\\nwas near the door he could hear somebody laughing inside his wife’s room. For\\nno reason the sound of laughing irritated him. Nandini never laughed like that\\nwhen she was in Thanjavur. What made her so happy now? Who was laughing\\nwith her?\\n\\n\\x0cThe moment he entered the room he knew that Manimekalai, daughter of\\nSambuvaraiyar, was laughing along with his wife. He was a little pacified. When\\nManimekalai saw him she covered her mouth with her hands struggling hard to\\nhide her laugh. But she burst out laughing once again. While still laughing she\\nran out of the room.\\n\\nNandini was also laughing. But she stopped abruptly on seeing her husband. She\\nregained her usual majestic poise.\\n\\n“Welcome, dear. Has the discussion ended? So soon?”\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar ignored her question.\\n\\n“Nandini, why did that silly girl laugh like that? Why is she running away\\nlaughing?”\\n\\n“She overheard part of the conversation that happened in the Court Hall. Her\\nroom is adjacent to the Hall and the walls are not perfectly sound proof. She\\nheard that part of the discussion where the Crown Prince talked about his grand\\nfathers and grand mothers. Manimekalai could not help laughing.”\\n\\n“But why the hell are you laughing with her?”\\n\\n“Yes. I did. I had to. I was waiting for her to go so that I can cry in silence. And\\nyou came.”\\n\\n\\x0cNandini could muster tears at her will. She wiped her tears.\\n\\n“Oh My God! I was a fool to have brought you here to be in the midst of these\\nidiots. Please bear with these people for just one more night. We shall leave for\\nThanjavur first thing in the morning.”\\n\\n“Why? So early? Is our work over here in Kadambur?”\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar faithfully relayed what happened in the Court Hall.\\n\\nNandini’s voice was very calm.\\n\\n“My Lord, you go to Thanjavur. I won’t come with you. I won’t leave this place\\nbefore teaching that arrogant Karikalan a lesson he would never forget in his life.\\nEither he should prostrate before you begging your forgiveness for what he\\nspoke today or he should fall a prey to your sword.”\\n\\n“What are you talking, Nandini? From when did you become so cruel?”\\n\\n“Somebody has insulted my dear husband. I want to take revenge. Is this your\\ndefinition of cruelty, my Lord?”\\n\\n“No, Nandini. Please listen. Our Pazhuvur clan has been associated with the\\n\\n\\x0cChozha clan for the past six generations. Simply because a flippant youth forgot\\nhistory and spoke whimsically, should I take arms against the great Chozha clan?\\nHow can I kill the Emperor’s son? How can I kill the Crown Prince with my\\nown hands?”\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar was trembling. He could not bear the thought of going against\\nthe Emperor and the Chozha dynasty.\\n\\nThere was another subtle reason for his outburst. When he heard the harsh words\\nof Karikalan his hand had instinctively reached for his sword. But he had\\ncontrolled himself then. Yes, a few minutes before he wanted to kill the Crown\\nPrince. But when Nandini told him what was in his mind he became nervous.\\n\\n“I understand, my Lord. You were associated with the Chozha clan for the past\\nsix generations. Yes, you can’t take the sword against the Crown Prince. But I\\ndon’t have any such restriction. I don’t owe any duty to the Chozha clan. If that\\narrogant Karikalan does not touch your feet I’ll kill him with my own hands.”\\n\\nNandini’s eyes had gone red. Her eye-brows were arched in anger. Her face had\\nchanged. Pazhuvettaraiyar had never seen so much rage on that beautiful face.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 39 - Calamity Ahead\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar smiled. He wanted to tease his young wife and so the smile was\\nvery mild. At least that was what he thought. But the sound of his smile caused\\nthe things in that room to tremble. His heart was about to burst in pride when he\\nheard that his young wife was ready to wield the sword against anyone who\\ninsulted him. He had a strange sense of euphoria. He was happy to know that\\nNandini was very keen in protecting his honour. He wanted her to speak in the\\nsame strain for some more time. At the same time he wanted to pretend that he\\ndid not like that kind of talk.\\n\\n“Why did you laugh, dear? You don’t believe me?”\\n\\n“No, Nandini. I fully believe you. I was wondering how you are going to wield a\\nheavy sword with your hand which is as soft as a flower. And what is the need\\nwhen I am alive and kicking with my two long arms ... “\\n\\n“I know the power and glory of your arms, dear. Your long arms are like the\\ntrunk of an elephant. They are as strong as the Vajrayutha, the formidable\\nweapon wielded by the chief of gods, the Devendra. Your arms have had the\\nhonour of killing thousands of enemies in the battle-field. It was your arms that\\ncrowned the Emperor of Chozha Kingdom. And it was your arms that saved\\nhim from any danger. But who thinks of all those things? Youngsters who are\\nstill green behind their ears have started calling you ‘old man’. And you, my\\ndear, behave like a snake which is caught in a spell. You silently bear all the\\ninsults because of your devotion to the rulers of the Chozha clan. I know, dear,\\nmy hands are very soft. They are fit for wearing bangles. But I held your strong\\nhands in the presence of the holy fire while marrying you. That has given some\\npower to my hands. If there be a need to save my chastity or your honour my\\narms would get the power to wield the heaviest of the swords. Look here!”\\n\\n\\x0cNandini bent down and pulled a box from beneath the cot. She opened the box\\nand took out the dresses. She then took out a long, shining sword from the box\\nand lifted it above her head with nonchalant grace.\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar was shocked.\\n\\n“How long was this sword inside this box? I thought the box had nothing but\\nyour dresses.”\\n\\nNandini kept the sword inside the box.\\n\\n“Yes, I keep my dresses and jewels inside this box. Of all the ornaments I have\\nthis sword is the most precious. And this sword has the power to guard the most\\nprecious ornament of a woman - I mean my chastity and it can save my\\nhusband’s honour as well.”\\n\\n“But I don’t think you will have a chance to use this sword; at least as long as I\\nam alive.”\\n\\n“That is why I never take this sword out of this box. You are capable of\\nprotecting the borders of this vast kingdom which extend from Sri Lanka to\\nVengi country. Can’t you protect yourself? You can guard an ordinary girl like\\nme with your strength, dear. But you are always involved in very important\\naffairs. You can’t be thinking about my safety all the time. When you are away\\non duty I should have some means to guard myself. That’s why I keep this sword\\nalong with my dresses and jewels.”\\n\\n\\x0c“What is the need, my dear? Of course you can keep the sword. But I won’t be\\naway from you in the future.”\\n\\n“That’s my wish too, dear. But just for once you may have to leave me here and\\ngo to Thanjavur to fetch Madhuranthakan.”\\n\\n“Why? Why are you adamant? Why should I go alone?” Pazhuvettaraiyar arched\\nhis brows and raised his voice.\\n\\nNandini was unfazed.\\n\\n“There are two reasons, my Lord. If you take me with you those idiots would\\nmake fun of both of us. ‘The old man doesn’t believe his young wife.’ They will\\ntalk behind our backs. My blood boils when I hear such comments. But there is\\nanother important reason, my Lord. You have been telling all along that\\nSambuvaraiyar is your best friend. But ever since the Crown Prince came here I\\nsee a change in his behaviour. Did you notice?”\\n\\n“Yes, dear. I too have been watching. I wonder what made him change.”\\n\\n“You are still innocent, dear. That’s why you are surprised by his change. But I\\nam not. Ambition is the basic trait of every man. And that is the reason for the\\nchange you find in him. It was rumoured till now that the Crown Prince never\\nlooks at women and has no idea of marrying anybody. But the Crown Prince’s\\nbehaviour in this Palace belies those rumours. He visits the ladies’ chambers\\nquite often. He talks with the women. He flirts with them. Do you know the\\n\\n\\x0creason? He is attracted to Sambuvaraiyar’s daughter, Manimekalai. Didn’t he\\nask, “Can we take Manimekalai with us for hunting?” Sambuvaraiyar has also\\nnoticed this change. A new desire has entered his mind. He has forgotten all our\\nold plans. He has started dreaming of seeing his only daughter as the Empress of\\nChozha Kingdom.”\\n\\n“You are right, Nandini. I never thought Sambuvaraiyar will stoop to that level.\\nTwo months ago we all joined hands to take a vow to make Madhuranthakan the\\nnext Chozha Emperor. But this man, blinded by ambition, has gone back on his\\nword. He is not fit to be a human being.”\\n\\n“That is the precise reason I do not want to come with you. I’ll be watching the\\nactions of these people during your absence. And if they plan something against\\nyour interests I’ll give my life and soul to thwart their plans.”\\n\\n“But Nandini, why should you get involved in all these dirty affairs?”\\n\\n“Am I not your life-partner, dear? Whatever affairs you are involved I will also\\nbe involved. What for did you marry me, dear?”\\n\\n“But Nandini I don’t want to leave you in the midst of fools and crooks. I don’t\\nhave the mind to leave you here, my dearest.”\\n\\n“I am not alone, dear. I have company. I have good support. Manimekalai is\\nthere for me. She will even die for me.”\\n\\n\\x0c“That’s true. I also noticed. Your beauty has enslaved her. But how long will that\\nlast? If Adithya Karikalan becomes the King and promises to make her his\\nEmpress?”\\n\\n“You need not have any doubt on that front, dear. Manimekalai will refuse such\\nrequest even if it comes from the chief of gods, if I do not approve of the match.\\nIf I give this sword to her and ask her to stab Karikalan she will do it for me. You\\nused to talk about my seductive power. Manimekalai is now completely under its\\ninfluence. If you want I can demonstrate my power to you right now.”\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar’s body trembled in fear. With his lips quivering he spoke in a\\nchoked voice.\\n\\n“Devi, I know your powers. But don’t test them on Karikalan. He is after all a\\nkid. Let us not take his words to heart. If he wants to marry Manimekalai let us\\nnot stand against it.”\\n\\n“Yes, my Lord. Let us not oppose the marriage. But we should not forget that\\nthere is something called destiny. Who can oppose Destiny, tell me.\\nManimekalai adores me. And I love her. I love her like my own sister. How can I\\nlet her marry a person who is going to face an untimely death?”\\n\\nNandini had a distant stare on her eyes.\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar was more nervous now.\\n\\n\\x0c“Oh My God! What are you saying, Nandini? I was once the head of Velakkara\\nArmy, the King’s bodyguards. I have sworn to give my life in order to protect\\nthe lives of the Emperor and his family.”\\n\\n“I never said that you should act against your promise.”\\n\\n“But, dear, if Karikalan is hurt because of you, the blame will fall on me. The\\nwhole world will accuse me” “Unable to bear a kid teasing him the old man has\\ncommitted this heinous crime.” And our family will lose the name and honour\\nthat has been earned during the last six generations.”\\n\\n“Then it is all the more important that you should leave this place immediately.”\\n\\n“What makes you say that?”\\n\\n“I have been wanting to share that with you for quite some time. Now the time\\nhas come. You know that the Goddess Durga Parameswari has given me some\\nunusual powers. It was through those powers I learnt that Emperor Sundara\\nChozhan is guilty of killing a woman in his younger days. I proved that to you as\\nwell.\\n\\n“In the same way I now see the end of Adithya Karikalan with those divine\\npowers. No, it is not going to happen because of you. Or me. But I am sure that\\nthe Goddess of Death is nearing him. He might die while he goes for hunting. Or\\nmight die while sleeping in this Palace. His death can be caused by wild animals\\nlike a tiger or a bear. Or he may die in the hands of one of his close friends,\\nwhose arrow might miss the target and hit him. Or he may die being killed by a\\ndagger in the soft hands of a woman. But my dear, I promise you, his death will\\n\\n\\x0cnot be caused by the hands of a woman who has married you in the presence of\\nthe holy fire. No, I assure you I won’t kill him.\\n\\n“I was an orphan on the street. You married me and made me the Queen of\\nPazhuvur. And it will be my first duty to make sure that you are not blamed in\\nthis affair. And that is the reason I insist that you should leave the place right\\nnow. If something happens to the Prince when you are here then the whole\\ncountry will say that you killed him. Didn’t they blame you for\\nArulmozhivarman’s death on the high seas? In the same way you will be blamed\\neven Karikalan’s death is nothing but an accident. But take it from me you\\ncannot prevent his death even with your strong arms.\\n\\n“So you should leave this place. Right now. Yes, you can take me with you. But\\nthat will make people suspicious. They will say, ‘Pazhuvettaraiyar knew this was\\ngoing to happen. So ran away from the scene along with his wife.’ You should\\ngo alone. I will be here to save your name and honour, dear. Do you trust me, my\\nLord?”\\n\\nNandini directed her big, black eyes at Pazhuvettaraiyar’s chest. It appeared as if\\nshe was trying to pierce his chest with that pointed glace. Poor soul!\\nPazhuvettaraiyar was visibly shaken by the arrows which came from her mouth\\nas pointed words. And now he could not stand the attack of arrows coming from\\nher beautiful eyes. He surrendered to her charms.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 40 - Water Sports\\n\\nSix hundred years before the time of this story there were seven famous\\nChieftains in Tamilnadu apart from the three great Tamil Kings - Cheras,\\nChozhas and Pandyas.\\n\\nThe seven chieftains were also known as great philanthropists. It is customary to\\nrefer to them as “The Seven Great Philanthropists.” One of the seven was Ori,\\nwho ruled over the Kolli Hills. Ori was an acclaimed master in archery. He was\\ncompared to Lord Rama in archery. Once Rama shot an arrow to prove a point,\\nor rather to prove his prowess to King Sugriva who was about to forge alliance\\nwith him. The arrow pierced seven trees which were not in a straight line.\\nSimilarly there was a legend that the arrow shot by the great Ori first pierced the\\nbody of a tiger, a deer, a boar and finally a rabbit. The great poets of Tamilnadu\\nhave glorified Ori’s archery in their songs. And because of this he was called as\\nthe “One Who is Adept In Wielding A Bow” or ‘Val-vil Ori’\\n\\nOnce one of the three Kings of Tamilnadu, the Chera King was furious over Ori.\\nThe Chera King wanted to finish off Ori; but he could not do it alone. He sought\\nthe assistance of Malaiyaman Thirumudikkari. Kari was no less than Ori. And\\nKari had an added advantage. He had a much stronger army than Ori.\\nMalaiyaman invaded the Kolli Hills, killed Ori and destroyed the fort built by\\nhim on the hills.\\n\\nAthikaman Nedumananchi was a Chieftain, like Ori. He was ruling over a small\\nterritory which was adjacent to Ori’s called, Thahadoor. Ori was his best friend.\\nAnd Nedumananchi wanted to avenge his friend’s death. He knew very well that\\nhe could not invade Malaiyaman Kari without help from other chieftains.\\n\\n\\x0cHe sought the help of the Chozha King at that time, one who went by the name\\nKillivalavan. Killi Valavan was already displeased with Malaiyaman because of\\nhis growing strength and his allegiance to the Chera King. Killivalavan was,\\ntherefore, only too eager to help the campaign launched by Athikaman\\nNedumananchi. They joined hands to attack Malaiyaman. Malaiyaman could not\\nwithstand the onslaught and he died on the battlefield. His two sons were held\\ncaptive by the soldiers of the Chozha Army.\\n\\nKillivalavan and Athikaman wanted to destroy the entire clan of Malaiyaman.\\nThe children were buried in sand up to their neck. The King’s elephants were\\norder to trample them. A poet who had once sung the praises of Malaiyaman and\\nhad gained personally by his philanthropy reached the place at the nick of time.\\nHe made a passionate plea to the Chozha Emperor on behalf of the innocent\\nchildren.\\n\\n“Your Majesty, please see the smile on the faces of these innocent children. They\\nare too young to know about their destiny. Blissfully unaware of the approaching\\ndeath they are laughing at the elephant’s trunk, which is dangling from its neck.\\nThey perhaps think that this is a different kind of circus. Are you going to kill\\nthese innocent children, Your Majesty? Is it fair to kill the children for the faults\\nof their father?”\\n\\nThe Chozha King changed his mind. He rescinded his orders. He ordered that\\nthe children be retrieved. When the children came of age he made the eldest son\\nthe ruler of Thirukkovalur.\\n\\nFrom that time onwards the clan of Thirukkovalur Malaiyaman had been faithful\\nfriends of the Chozha clan. It was friendship rooted in gratitude. The relationship\\nextended till the time of Sundara Chozhan, for the Emperor had married,\\nVanamaadevi, who was the daughter of Malayaman.\\n\\n\\x0cMeanwhile the clans of Ori and Athikaman lost their powers and vanished from\\nhistory. The Kadambur Sambuvaraiyars claimed that they were descendants of\\nOri and Athikaman. They never forgot the enmity of Oris with the Malaiyamans.\\nIn these circumstances it was quite natural that the Sambuvaraiyar did not want\\nthe grandson of a Malaiyaman to become a Chozha Emperor.\\n\\nAdithya Karikalan’s arrogance, his attitude of treating the Chieftains like dirt\\nfuelled the hatred of Sambuvaraiyar. That made him actively participate in the\\nconspiracy to place Kandaraathithar’s son, Madhuranthakan, on the Thanjavur\\nthrone.\\n\\nBut ever since Karikalan came to Kadambur, Sambuvaraiyar’s mind was going\\nthrough a gradual change. It was his darling daughter Manimekalai, who brought\\nthis change in her father. There were unmistakable signs that Manimekalai had\\nstolen the heart of the Crown Prince.\\n\\nIt was rumoured that Karikalan would never look at women and that he had\\nvowed to remain unmarried throughout his life. But Karikalan spent most of his\\ntime in the ladies’ chambers in the Kadambur Palace. He was talking in a\\nflirtatious tone to the women of the Royal Household. In particular he was\\npraising Manimekalai’s natural gift of enthusiasm. Manimekalai too appeared to\\nbe deliriously happy since the arrival of the Crown Prince. Sambuvaraiyar\\nnaively thought that his daughter too had fallen for the Prince’s charm. He was\\npleased to see his daughter and the Crown Prince being happy in each other’s\\ncompany. If his daughter married Karikalan she would become the Empress of\\nthe vast Chozha Kingdom.\\n\\nAnd the child born to her would succeed Karikalan to the Chozha throne.\\nWhatever honour and glory that Malaiyaman was enjoying today would be his in\\nthe next generation.\\n\\n\\x0cWhy should I interfere with the Lady Luck who is eager to visit my Palace? Why\\nshould I stand in the way of my daughter’s glory?\\n\\nIt was true that Sambuvaraiyar wanted to give his daughter’s hand to\\nMadhuranthakan the heir apparent to the Chozha throne. But Madhuranthakan\\nalready had two wives. And one of his wives was the daughter of the Junior\\nPazhuvettaraiyar. He also had a son through her. So if Madhuranthakan was\\ncrowned the King, Pazhuvettaraiyar’s clan would come in the direct line of\\nsuccession. Sambuvaraiyar’s daughter Manimekalai would be one of the\\nthousands of maids in Thanjavur Palace.\\n\\nBut if Manimekalai married Adithya Karikalan she would be the Empress of the\\nChozha Kingdom. Her son would be crowned the King after Karikalan. Again it\\nwas next to impossible to make Madhuranthakan the King. People were against\\nhim. And they would have to wage a war against Malaiyaman and Kodumbalur\\nChieftain to achieve the near impossible feat of making Madhuranthakan the\\nEmperor.\\n\\nEven Madhuranthakan’s mother would oppose the move. Why should we get\\ninto that kind of a trouble where there was no gain for him or his family?\\n\\nOn the other hand Adithya Karikalan’s coronation was a decided issue. It was\\nnot likely to be opposed. The only possible resistance would be the adamant\\nattitude of Pazhuvettaraiyars. Of the two brothers, the elder one, at his age, was a\\nslave to his young wife’s beauty. How long would he live, nobody knew. Why\\nshould Sambuvaraiyar undertake a risky venture relying only on the support of\\nthat old man? Yes, it was true that Sambuvaraiyar had pledged his support to\\nMadhuranthakan. So what? Let me explore the ways of accomplishing my desire\\nwithout violating the pledge.\\n\\n\\x0cMadhuranthakan was a gullible person. It was easy even to make him refuse the\\nthrone. He did not even go to that extent. Enough if Madhuranthakan said that\\nwithout his mother’s blessings he would not accept the Crown.\\n\\nSambuvaraiyar’s mind had started thinking in these lines. That made him\\nenthusiastically support the Pazhuvettaraiyar’s decision of going to Thanjavur to\\nbring Madhuranthakan. Pazhuvettaraiyar’s absence would give Sambuvaraiyar\\nopportunities for a “heart to heart” talk with Adithya Karikalan. Once he knew\\nwhat was in the Crown Prince’s mind then he could devise his strategy\\naccordingly. He hastened Pazhuvettaraiyar’s trip to Thanjavur and personally\\narranged a retinue to go with him.\\n\\nPazhuvettaraiyar left for his long journey. Karikalan and his friends went for\\nhunting. Sambuvaraiyar was even ready to send his daughter, Manimekalai, and\\nher friends along with the hunting expedition. But Kandhanmaran who had been\\nseeing things from a different perspective strongly objected to it. Kandhanmaran\\nwas shrewd enough to know that the attention Karikalan paid to Manimekalai\\nwas only on account of Nandini. That made him hate the Crown Prince even\\nmore. He could not explain the subtle relationship to his father.\\n\\nHence he opted for the usual arguments - “What’s the use of girls while we are\\ngoing on a hunting expedition? If they came with us, we will be spending most\\nof our time worrying about their safety. Again, this is the Tamil month of\\nAippasi (October - November) Rains may come at any moment. . There might\\nbe floods. The ladies will be stranded.”\\n\\nSambuvaraiyar abandoned the idea of sending his daughter. Karikalan left for\\nhunting along with his friends Parthibendran, Vandhiya Thevan, Kandhanmaran\\nand a group of hunters.\\n\\n\\x0cSambuvaraiyar’s Palace now wore a deserted look. But for Sambuvarayar, there\\nwere no men in the palace.\\n\\nNandini started to make her move. She spoke to Manimekalai.\\n\\n“Men were a nuisance to us when they were here. But if all of them are away\\nthen we start missing them. There is nothing to make fun of. It’s boring.”\\n\\n“Yes, Akka. We too could have gone with them. I want to see hunting. I used to\\ngo with my father and my brother. But today Kandhanmaran was quite adamant\\nin stopping us. I don’t know why. Perhaps he knows that you hate hunting and\\nthat was the reason for his ban.”\\n\\n“Yes, Manimekalai. I don’t like hunting. I am allergic to blood. But that was not\\nthe reason for Kandhanmaran’s ban. He was particular in keeping you away\\nfrom one of the guests. That was why he did not want us to come.”\\n\\nDimples appeared on Manimekalai’s cheeks. After some time she replied.\\n\\n“Let the men go to hell, Akka! Who cares! Who needs their company, anyway?\\nBut Akka, I have a plan. Why don’t we go to the Mandapam in the middle of the\\nlake to have a swim?”\\n\\nNandini agreed. Manimekalai made the arrangements.\\n\\n\\x0cOn the eastern side of the gigantic Veeranarayana Lake there was a huge bank\\nand seventy four canals that carry water from the lake to agricultural lands.\\nThere was no such bank on the Western Side. On the western side the water level\\nwas low and near the bank it was almost at the ground level. Further west were\\nthe dense forests.\\n\\nNear the western bank, where the water level was low, there were some small\\nislets here and there. These islets were thick in vegetation. In one of these islets\\non the western side there were steps and a Mandapam. The women of the\\nKadambur Palace used to visit this place to have a bath and entertain themselves\\nwith water sports. To reach this place one had to go around the lake for about ten\\nmiles. Because of the distance and because of the fact that the place was\\nreserved for the women of the royal household, people never came near that\\nplace.\\n\\nNandini and Manimekalai got on a boat and rowed to this secluded place. There\\nwere two maids who did the rowing. They had even bought vessels and\\nprovisions for cooking. As soon as the boat reached the Mandapam the maids\\ngot down and started cooking.\\n\\nNandini and Manimekalai sat on the steps to gossip about the members of the\\nRoyal household. Manimekalai was intelligent, talented and quite mischievous.\\nShe mimicked the voice of Pazhuvettaraiyar, Karikalan, Kandhanmaran,\\nParthibendran and Vandhiya Thevan. Nandini could not control her laugh. But\\nNandini’s mind was not there. It had drifted to a secret corner of her mind where\\nsomething crucial was cooking.\\n\\nSuddenly Manimekalai stood up with a jolt.\\n\\n“Akka, we have not come for hunting. But you know hunting is coming towards\\n\\n\\x0cus.”\\n\\nShe shouted while pulling out a knife from her waist.\\n\\nNandini was shocked. She looked at the spot pointed out by Manimekalai. On a\\nleaning branch of a large tree there was a leopard. It was looking at the two\\nwomen as if it was making its mind whether to spring on them or not.\\n\\nThey also heard the sound of horses galloping in water.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 41 - Karikalan’s Murderous Frenzy\\n\\nAdithya Karikalan had told his hosts that it had been long since he went for\\nhunting and that he had almost forgotten the art of archery. But those who saw\\nhim hunting wild beasts on the banks of Veeranarayana Lake that day did not\\nthink so. Rabbits, deer, bears and leopards fell dead in quick succession unable\\nto bear the onslaught of arrows that burst out from his bow. When there were no\\nanimals around, he aimed his arrows at the birds flying high in the sky. Eagles\\nand falcons fell dead screaming. Karikalan was in a state of murderous frenzy.\\nAnd the pace increased as time went on. His companions did not have much to\\ndo.\\n\\nAs men and horses went through the forest making a huge noise the animals ran\\nfor shelter. That was the only help his companions provided for his hunting. He\\ndid not even let his companions shoot arrows at the animals that came to attack\\nhim. Once Kandhanmaran shot an arrow at the bear that just managed to\\nnarrowly miss Karikalan. Karikalan turned to his friend.\\n\\n“Kandhanmaran, are you trying to kill the bear or me?”\\n\\nKandhanmaran was furious. He never bent his bow thereafter.\\n\\nEveryone was exhausted when the sun was at its peak. All his companions\\nwanted to rest for a while before returning to the palace. But Karikalan was\\ndriving his exhausted horse with the kind of fury no one could imagine.\\n\\nIn the morning Kandhanmaran was riding close to the Crown Prince. But once\\n\\n\\x0cKarikalan asked him “Are you trying to kill me?” he retreated and started riding\\nwith Parthibendra Pallavan. He started complaining to Parthibendran about the\\nharsh words and the cruel behaviour of the Prince. Parthibendran did his best to\\npacify him.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan now approached Karikalan and was riding very close to him.\\nVandhiya Thevan did not have bow or arrows. He was not well-versed in\\narchery. He had a spear. He never interfered with the Prince’s hunting. He was\\nextremely watchful. He was ready to use his spear should an occasion arise. And\\ntill noon such an occasion did not present itself.\\n\\nKandhanmaran meanwhile continued his complaint.\\n\\n“Is it not enough for the day? At this rate he will kill all the animals in the forest\\nbefore the end of the day. Only the large forest at Kolli Hills will give him outlet\\nfor his frenzy. Why don’t you ask him to return? Why don’t you tell him to call it\\na day?”\\n\\n“Thambi, something is troubling the Prince. It is not easy to give up a large\\nempire. The Crown Prince perhaps is showing all his pent up fury on the hapless\\nanimals. In a way that’s good. If there had been no hunting he would have\\nvented his feelings on you and me. Let’s keep quiet. Let us wait till he gets tired\\nand says, “Enough for the day.”\\n\\nAt that time the whole forest was shaken by a frightening sound. It was the\\ngrunting sound of a wild animal. Kandhanmaran’s face went pale.\\n\\n“Oh My God! It’s a wild boar. Please ask the Prince to stop.”\\n\\n\\x0c“It’s a boar, after all. Didn’t you see how the tigers and bears suffered from the\\nPrince’s arrows?”\\n\\n“You don’t know about wildlife in this area. The boars in this forest can even kill\\na tiger or a bear. They even attack an elephant. Horses can’t stand their ferocity\\neven for a few seconds. The boar’s skin is so thick that arrows and spears will\\nbounce off from their body. PRINCE, STOP! STOP! PLEASE STOP! DON’T\\nGO AFTER THAT BOAR.”\\n\\nThere was a whirlwind in the bushes near them. Two wild boars which\\nresembled elephant calves came out of the bushes. They saw the horses and the\\nmen riding them.\\n\\n“Careful. They are dangerous.” Kandhanmaran screamed.\\n\\nMeanwhile the professional hunters ran up to the place and started playing their\\ndrums furiously making awkward noises.\\n\\nThe boars saw the circus. Perhaps they thought of their young ones. Perhaps they\\nthought that their young ones might be in danger. Or they were frightened by the\\nsound of the drums. They started to run off in opposite directions.\\n\\nKandhanmaran saw them running.\\n\\n“My Lord, let them go. Let’s not follow them. We cannot follow a boar without\\n\\n\\x0cthe help of five or six trained hunter dogs.”\\n\\nKarikalan did not pay heed. He bent his bow and shot an arrow training his eyes\\non one of the boars. The arrow did not miss its mark. It stuck to the body of the\\nboar. Karikalan let out a victorious roar. The next second the boar shook its body.\\nThe arrow fell down. The boar resumed its running.\\n\\nKandhanmaran laughed. And it was like insulting the Crown Prince. Karikalan\\ndid not miss the insinuation. “Kandhanmaran! Vandhiya Thevan and I’ll go\\nbehind that boar. We’ll kill it and bring the body back here. You and\\nParthibendran go after the other boar. We shall not return to the Palace without\\nkilling these two animals. Challenge?”\\n\\nHe did not wait for Kandhanmaran’s response. He kicked his horse. It started to\\nrun. Vandhiya Thevan followed the Crown Prince.\\n\\nFor a while they could trace the path of the wild boar. For the beast had crushed\\nthe bushes on the way and had left tell-tale evidence. They then encountered a\\ncanal. The canal was built as a kind of rain-harvesting mechanism. The canal\\ncarried the rain-water from the forest to the lake. The duo could not find out in\\nwhich direction the boar went. Did it cross the canal and go deeper into the\\nforest? Or did it run on the banks of the canal?\\n\\nThey could see the huge Veeranarayana Lake through the canal. They could see\\na boat on the lake. They could also see that all the passengers on board were\\nwomen. But they could not recognize them from that distance. At first it\\nappeared that the boat was coming towards their direction. Then the boat turned\\nand went towards an islet near the bank. After some time the boat disappeared\\nfrom their view.\\n\\n\\x0c“Vandhiya Theva, did you see that? Who were in that boat? I think all of them\\nwere women.”\\n\\n“I too think so, Prince. But I don’t know who they are.”\\n\\n“Perhaps the women are from Sambuvaraiyar’s household.”\\n\\n“Quite possible. But why should they come this far?”\\n\\n“You are right. It can’t be them. But are you sure that Pazhuvettaraiyar has left\\nKadambur?”\\n\\n“I am sure, Your Highness. I saw the gates of Palace being opened in the\\nmorning and his leaving on an elephant’s back.”\\n\\n“Did he go alone?”\\n\\n“Yes, he did. The Junior Queen did not accompany the old man.”\\n\\n“When are we going to see another warrior like him? You know my grandfather\\nMalaiyaman too is a great warrior. But I’d rate him only next to\\nPazhuvettaraiyar.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Your Highness, I’ve heard people talking about these old men. But I have seen\\nyour valour in the battlefield with my own eyes. I saw it in the Kadambur Palace\\nas well. You made them all, young and old, shake in fear.”\\n\\n“That’s true. I made that kind of a fuss for a specific reason. I wanted to drive\\nthat old man away so that I can do something which I’ve wanted to do for ages.\\nThe time has come now. But you know my mind and my body are trembling.\\nYou can never see a worse coward than me in the whole Chozha Kingdom.”\\n\\n“Your Highness, I’ve been watching you since this morning. You don’t appear to\\nbe trembling in fear. On the other hand you made all those wild animals and the\\nbirds, why, even those who came with you tremble in fear.”\\n\\n“Do you call that bravery? Do you think hunting is an act of valour? A hunting\\ndog at times kills a leopard. A wild boar fights with the mighty elephant.\\nHunting is not act of valour. Listen, my dear friend, my conspiracy worked.\\nPazhuvettaraiyar has left Nandini alone. But I am still afraid of meeting her and\\ntalking to her.”\\n\\n“I can understand, Prince. You had a soft corner for her all these years. But now\\nyou know that she is your own sister. She is now working with the conspirators\\nof Pandya Kingdom. She is keen on destroying the entire Chozha clan. It is very\\ndifficult to discuss these things with her. I could not do that, Prince, though I had\\nan opportunity to do so.”\\n\\n“My dear friend, I was shocked by this new development. I could not believe\\neven now that she could be my sister. But when I think of what happened in the\\npast it looks quite credible. In those days there was a screen between me and\\n\\n\\x0cNandini. Queen Mother - I mean Sembian Madevi - was particular that I should\\nnot have anything to do with Nandini. But she never told us the whole truth. If\\nonly she had, we could have avoided many complications.”\\n\\n“Even the Queen Mother might not know, Your Highness. She might have\\nthought of Nandini as an orphan girl. She might not have known that Nandini is\\nthe daughter of Emperor Sundara Chozhan.”\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 42 - “She Is Not A Woman”\\n\\nThe Crown Prince was lost in thoughts. Childhood memories flooded his mind.\\nFor a while, they made his mind boil and then disappeared giving place to other\\nmemories. Karikalan forcefully controlled those thoughts and as a sign of victory\\nlet out a long sigh. He spoke to Vandhiya Thevan in a calm voice.\\n\\n“Let bygones be bygones. Let’s just talk about the future. That was the reason I\\npulled you out of the crowd. Looks like we have lost the bet, for the wild boar is\\nnowhere to be seen. Vallavaraiya, Let us use this time to discuss what should be\\ndone now and how should we do it. I shudder to think how I am going to talk to\\nNandini about the blood relationship I share with her. I can’t even look at her\\nface now. When I accidentally see her face she retains the expression she had\\nwhen she pleaded for the life of Veerapandiyan. Her eyes seem at that time like a\\nsharp sword which pierces my heart. My heart bleeds when I think that my own\\nsister, my own blood, out of her love for Veerapandiyan so passionately pleaded\\nfor his life. What do you think Vandhiya Theva? Do you think she does not\\nknow the truth yet? Do you think that she still does not know that she is the\\nEmperor’s daughter and my dear sister?”\\n\\n“My Lord, if she had known she would not have joined hands with the\\nconspirators of Pandya Kingdom. If only she had known that the Emperor is her\\nfather she would not have let a child sit on a throne and crowned him as the King\\nof Pandyas and the Emperor of the Chozha Kingdom. She would not have\\ndrawn her sword and would not have sworn to save the Crown and the throne\\neven at the cost of her life. I saw all these things in Thiruppurambayam War\\nMemorial at midnight on that fateful day. Yes, my Lord, that is not hearsay; I\\nsaw it with my own eyes.”\\n\\n“I am surprised why she let you live after you had seen all those things.”\\n\\n\\x0c“There is nothing odd about it, my Lord. It might be due to the natural\\ncompassion in any woman’s heart.”\\n\\n“Vandhiya Theva, you are innocent. You do not know about the ways of the\\nworld. You don’t know the deceit and treachery that can lie in a woman’s heart. I\\ndon’t know why she let you go alive. But I know intuitively why she sent a\\nsecret message to me to come here to Kadambur.”\\n\\n“Why, Prince?”\\n\\n“She wants to kill me. She wants to take revenge for the death of Veerapandiyan.\\n“\\n\\n“Your Highness, Princess Kunthavai and the Chief Minister sent me here\\nprecisely to avert that kind of a catastrophe. I told you several times not to go to\\nKadambur. But you never listened to me, Prince.”\\n\\n“Vandhiya Theva, Kunthavai and the Chief Minister are very intelligent people.\\nBut even then they cannot block the hands of Destiny. I think Destiny wants to\\nvindicate what the astrologers told about my brother Arulmozhi - that he will be\\nthe Emperor of the three worlds. And perhaps that was the reason Destiny pulled\\nme up here. Who knows what will happen to me here? Vandhiya Theva, did you\\nsee Kandhanmaran shooting the arrow from behind? Did he want to hit the bear\\nor me?”\\n\\n“I didn’t see, my Lord. But I don’t think Kandhanmaran will stoop to the level of\\n\\n\\x0csuch a blatant betrayal. I don’t think Kandhanmaran will kill his guest, and that\\ntoo the Emperor’s son and that too from behind. No, he won’t do that, Your\\nHighness. Well, I don’t have any regards for his intelligence. He was slain and\\nwas lying unconscious. It was I who carried him from there and saved him.\\nBecause I was the first person he saw after he opened his eyes he thought that I\\nwas the one who stabbed him. Since that day he considers me his first enemy\\nand has been hostile to me. He may not be smart; but he is not treacherous, my\\nLord. He could not have done that.”\\n\\n“My dear friend, you don’t know the seductive powers of a beautiful woman. It\\ncan even make the best of men to betray.”\\n\\n“My Lord, I too know something about the seductive charms of a woman. But\\nnever in my life will I betray any one.”\\n\\n“Oh! But Manimekalai is a good girl. She will never induce you to do an act of\\nbetrayal.”\\n\\n“I am not talking of Manimekalai, My Lord. Do you think fireflies will appear\\nattractive to a man who has seen the Full Moon itself?”\\n\\n“Whom do you call as Full Moon?”\\n\\n“Please bear with me, my Lord. I am referring to the Princess at Pazhaiyaarai.”\\n\\n“ Upstart! You naughty boy! The greatest kings on earth are longing for\\n\\n\\x0cKunthavai’s hand. You should not even think of my sister in that manner.”\\n\\n“Prince, the Full Moon gives its rays to the Emperors of the world. Even the\\npoor and homeless delight in the rays of the moon. Who can prevent them?”\\n\\n“You are right. There is no point in getting angry with you. In fact I intentionally\\nsent you to my sister with a message. I think she must be pleased with you.\\nOtherwise you won’t talk like this. But don’t share this with Parthibendra\\nPallavan. His long term dream is to become the son-in-law of the Chozha\\nEmperor and thereby become the King of Thondai Mandalam.”\\n\\n“That must have been the situation some time before. Not now, Your Highness.\\nRight now Parthibendran and Kandhanmaran are at the feet of Nandini Devi.\\nHer slightest whim is a divine command to them. They are ready to give their\\nlives for her.”\\n\\n“I have been watching that development, my friend. In fact I am a little afraid of\\nthose two people now.”\\n\\n“Considering the developments I think it is high time that you meet Nandini and\\ntell her truth.”\\n\\n“My dear friend, I don’t think I’d have the courage to do that. Why don’t you\\nspeak to her on my behalf?”\\n\\n“She won’t believe me, my Lord. Once I deceived her and went away from her\\n\\n\\x0chold. So she might think even this is a kind of deception.”\\n\\n“But tell me how I can meet Nandini alone. She is always in the ladies’\\nchambers.”\\n\\n“I can help you, Prince. Through Manimekalai. Leave it to me.”\\n\\n“Looks like Manimekalai will dance to your tunes. That’s a good development.\\nIf I manage to get her married to you, I’ll be happy.”\\n\\n“No, my Lord. I consider Manimekalai as my sister. I want her to marry\\nsomebody far higher in stature than me.”\\n\\n“I don’t get it.”\\n\\n“That’s news to me, my Lord. I am sure that the girl has reserved a soft corner\\nfor herself in the heart of the Crown Prince of Chozha Kingdom. Honestly,\\nPrince, I talked about Manimekalai as firefly compared to the Full Moon of\\nKunthavai. But the truth is that no one in this world with the only exception of\\nPrincess Kunthavai can be equal to Manimekalai in intelligence and qualities. If\\nyou married Manimekalai all our problems will be solved. Sambuvaraiyar and\\nKandhanmaran will come to our side. Pazhuvettaraiyars will be isolated. Nandini\\ntoo will be weakened. Madhuranthakan cannot even dream of becoming the\\nKing. We will crush the conspiracy of the Chieftains; we can destroy the diabolic\\nplans of the body-guards of Pandyas.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Thambi, you are right. But I have not come to Kadambur to get married. I think\\nwe are caught. I am sure Pazhuvettaraiyar is going to come back to Kadambur\\nwith a big army.”\\n\\n“Then why don’t we send word to your grandfather, the King of Thirukkovalur\\nto come with an army? Should we not be prepared for such an eventuality?”\\n\\n“I am thinking of that. At times I can’t control my temper. I want to raze this\\nKadambur Palace to the ground and hang all those bloody conspirators at the\\npalace gates. I am controlling myself only because of my father. If only you had\\nbrought him to Kanchi... “\\n\\n“Prince, even to deliver your letter... Oh My God... that was the hardest mission I\\never handled.”\\n\\n“Yes. The Emperor is virtually held as a hostage by the Pazhuvettaraiyars. I have\\nbuilt a Golden Palace for my parents at Kanchi. The Palace is vacant; only bats\\nare living there now. I don’t think I will have the blessing of receiving my\\nparents in the Palace when I am alive. I don’t think I’ll go out of Kadambur\\nalive.”\\n\\n“I am worried, my Lord. No I am frightened. As I hear you talk I think it is all\\nthe more necessary to summon the armed forces of King Malaiyaman.”\\n\\n“I am thinking of deputing you for that purpose.”\\n\\n\\x0c“I am sorry, Your Highness. I have strict orders from your sister never to leave\\nyou alone even for a second.”\\n\\n“You have been true to your orders till now.”\\n\\n“Parthibendra Pallavan does not have much to do in Kadambur Palace. He finds\\nit difficult to while away his time.”\\n\\n“You are right. Every second he does not see Nandini is like a century to him. I\\nnever thought Parthibendran will become a slave to a woman’s beauty. Let us\\nsend him to Malaiyaman.”\\n\\n“That’s the right thing to do, My Lord.”\\n\\n“If something happens in his absence you are there to protect me.”\\n\\n“Prince, whether I am there or not, whether anybody is there or not to guard you,\\nI am sure no one in this world will dare to hurt you. Those old warriors were\\ntalking derisively about you in your absence; but they have been trembling in\\nfear ever since they saw you.”\\n\\n“Thambi, I am not afraid of any man who wants to fight with me with a sword\\nface to face. I am frightened of those like Kandhanmaran who want to kill me\\nfrom behind.”\\n\\n\\x0c“But my Lord, you have again started accusing Kandhanmaran.”\\n\\n“Listen, Thambi. I am afraid of the evil in a woman’s heart. As I think of what a\\nwoman’s heart can hold I tremble in fear. When she sees me in that mysterious\\nway I feel a spear is piercing my chest. When I think of her I become weak in\\nmy legs.”\\n\\n“My Lord, yes, you should fear Nandini. I am not denying that. I know the kind\\nof hatred that resides in her heart. When I think of why she let me go on that day\\nI am afraid there might be a treacherous plan behind that seemingly innocent act.\\nBut all these fears arise because she does not know the truth. If you tell her that\\nyou are her brother then all our fears and worries will go away.”\\n\\n“Do you think so, Vallavaraiya? You are smart. But you are too innocent to know\\nhow a woman’s mind will think. If Nandini knows that she is Sundara Chozhan’s\\ndaughter her hatred will become a hundred fold. Even if we all promise to make\\nher the Empress of Chozha Kingdom she won’t be pacified.”\\n\\n“Prince, if that is what you think, then leave the job to me. I’ll reveal the secret\\nto Nandini Devi and try to pacify her.”\\n\\n“Even you can’t do that, my friend. No one can assuage her hard feelings.\\nListen. If our Chozha clan has to be saved either I have to die. Or she has to die.\\nOr both have to die. Let me kill her with the same sword which I used on\\nVeerapandiyan.”\\n\\n“What is this, Prince? Why do you talk like that?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Vandhiya Theva, it is all right to kill a person to save a Kingdom. What if the\\nperson killed happens to be a woman? What if the woman happens to be my own\\nsister? In fact Nandini is not a woman. She is a devil in the guise of a woman.\\nAnd if we let her live the great Chozha clan which has been flourishing since the\\ntime of Vijayalaya Chozha will go to dogs. Oh My God! What is that?”\\n\\nAdithya Karikalan was startled by the sudden noise.\\n\\nThere was some rustling sound coming from the bushes nearby. It appeared that\\nsomebody was fighting there. They rode to that place. It was a very rare sight. A\\nwild boar was fighting with a leopard.\\n\\n“Aha! The man we have been searching for is here,” shouted Karikalan. He was\\nobviously referring to the wild boar which they were chasing a little while ago.\\n\\n“I think the leopard will finish him. We won’t have anything to do.”\\n\\n“Do you think so? Just watch the fun.”\\n\\nIt was an interesting sight. The Leopard pounced on the boar and was trying to\\nkill it with its teeth and claws. But the thick skin of the boar did not yield to the\\nleopard’s attacks. Soon the boar got the upper hand. It ran towards the leopard\\nand with its short horns knocked down to the ground and gave hell to the wild\\ncat. The long teeth of the boar tore the skin of the leopard. When finally the boar\\nknocked it down for a second time the leopard lay on the ground dead.\\n\\n\\x0c“Thambi, the leopard is dead. The boar will now turn towards us. Let us be\\nprepared.”\\n\\nKarikalan loaded his bow with an arrow and aimed at the boar.\\n\\nThe arrow hit the neck of the boar. The boar shook his body. The arrow fell\\ndown. It turned around to look at the two horses and the riders. Then it saw the\\nfallen leopard. The boar was sure no harm would come from the wild cat. It now\\nsprang on the horses with enormous ferocity. Before Karikalan could load his\\nbow with an arrow the boar attacked his horse. The horse was overwhelmed by\\nthe sudden attack causing it to shift its hind legs. They were caught in the roots\\nof a tree. The horse could no longer sustain its balance and it fell down.\\nKarikalan was trapped under the horse. The boar retreated a few steps and went\\nfor the fallen horse with even greater ferocity.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 43 - Where Is The Leopard?\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan was quick to find out that Adithya Karikalan was in danger. In\\na flash he rode towards the wild boar and inserted his spear into its thick skin.\\nThe spear was stuck. The boar shook itself violently and turned around to look at\\nthe aggressor. Vandhiya Thevan lost the grip of the handle. Soon the spear fell\\noff from the body of the beast.\\n\\nThe boar now turned towards Vandhiya Thevan. It was only then that he realised\\nthat he was trapped. His horse could not withstand the onslaught. He was\\nunarmed. The only weapon he carried, a spear, was no longer with him. The\\nPrince was still caught under his horse and was trying to come out. The only way\\nout for Vandhiya Thevan was to grab the branch of a tree without getting down\\nfrom the horse. After having escaped so many great dangers in the recent past\\nVandhiya Thevan detested being killed by a wild boar.\\n\\nThank God there was a low lying branch nearby. Vandhiya Thevan sprang to the\\nbranch from the horse. He held the branch with all his strength and climbed on to\\nthe branch. At the same time the boar attacked his horse. The horse lost its\\nbalance and was about to fall down. It somehow managed to avoid the fall and\\nrun away.\\n\\nKarikalan was still trapped under his horse. Vandhiya Thevan was dangerously\\nperched on the tree-branch. The boar stood between the two men looking at them\\nalternately.\\n\\nIt was perhaps making a judgment as to whom should it attack first. The Prince\\nhad not yet come out from under his horse. Even if he did, whether he would be\\n\\n\\x0cable to handle the boar without any weapon or help was a big question. Of\\ncourse he had his bow and arrows. But it may take some time to load the arrow\\nin the bow and shoot. The boar might take advantage of the time-gap and might\\nattack him. Again the Prince might have been seriously injured. So the best\\nstrategy available to Vandhiya Thevan now was to distract the boar and attract it\\ntowards him, so that the Prince could buy some precious time.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan thought fast. He made several quick decisions. He shook the\\nbranch he was sitting on and made some strange sounds with his mouth with a\\nview to distract the boar.\\n\\nHis strategy worked. The boar ran ferociously towards the tree.\\n\\n“Let it come. Let the wild beast hit against the strong tree trunk.” Vandhiya\\nthought with a glee. His happiness did not last long. The branch on which he was\\nsitting cracked with a huge noise.\\n\\nOh My God! What is this? If I were to fall along with the branch, the boar’s teeth\\nwill tear me apart the very next second. I have to get hold of another branch.\\nNOW!\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan tried to grab another branch. The branch was a little away.\\nOnly one of his hands could reach the branch. The branch was frail. His hand\\nstarted to slip. His legs were dangling in the air.\\n\\nOh My God! There is no other way. I have to fall down to instantaneous death.\\nBut I am happy that I could save the Crown Prince in my dying moments.\\nKarikalan is likely to tell this to Kunthavai. She will be happy. And she is likely\\n\\n\\x0cto shed a few drops of tears for me. That is more than enough for me.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan heard a terrible noise. His hands slipped from the branch. He\\nclosed his eyes and fell down with a noisy thud. And soon became unconscious.\\n\\nWhen he came back he saw Adithya Karikalan sprinkling water on him. He sat\\nup.\\n\\n“My God! Prince, you are alive!”\\n\\n“Yes, I am, thanks to your help.”\\n\\n“What happened to the boar?”\\n\\n“It’s there.”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan looked in that direction. The boar lay dead.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan looked at it for some time.\\n\\n“Your Highness, such a small animal gave us so much trouble! Whatever\\nKandhanmaran said about the wild boars of this area is true. But tell me, my\\nLord, how did you manage to kill the beast?”\\n\\n\\x0c“I didn’t kill. It was you. And your spear.”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan was puzzled.\\n\\n“You have put my spear to the best possible use. But I didn’t do anything, my\\nLord. I am ashamed that I could not help when you were in danger.”\\n\\n“Didn’t you shake the branch and shout at the beast? I came out from under my\\nhorse at that time. I took your spear. I vented all my pent up fury on the boar.\\nPoor beast! As soon as the spear hit its body it made a terrible sound. I thought\\nI’d go deaf hearing that sound. But it did not die of the spear alone. You fell\\nfrom the tree. You fell right on the boar. The beast died of shock.”\\n\\nAdithya Karikalan laughed. Vandhiya Thevan joined him.\\n\\n“Because I fell on the boar I was not injured. You know, my Lord, our\\nmythology tells the story of our kind Lord who took the form of a boar to kill a\\ndemon. Till now I could not believe that. But after seeing the antics of this wild\\nboar our mythology seems credible to me. Oh My God! What a ferocious beast!”\\n\\n“Don’t judge the incarnation of Varaha (boar) by this little beast. In the forest\\nranges of Vindhya in the North there lives a boar with a single horn. It’s as huge\\nas an elephant. If this boar were to be of that size and if it had hit the tree with all\\nits force just imagine what would have happened to the tree?”\\n\\n\\x0c“The tree would have been uprooted. The spear you threw would have been\\nbroken. We would have been killed. That would have saved the trouble for the\\nenemies of the Chozha clan.”\\n\\n“Thambi, tell me the truth. When my horse fell down you threw the spear. Was it\\nfor the boar or for me?”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan was furious.\\n\\n“My Lord, is that you who are asking this question? If you don’t trust me you\\ncould have killed me. Why did you kill the boar and save me?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes. I should not doubt your intentions. If you had not shaken the tree\\nbranch and made that terrible noise the boar would have killed me. But when\\nyou threw the spear I had my doubts. You know nowadays I suspect everything\\nand everybody. I can’t shake off the thought that the Lord of Death is constantly\\nfollowing me. I thought that the Lord of Death came in the form of a boar.”\\n\\n“That’s a good sign, my Lord. Death that followed you is dead. All our worries\\nare gone. And we have won in our challenge with Kandhanmaran. Let us drag\\nthis boar. Shall we leave now?”\\n\\n“What’s the need to hurry? I am tired. Why don’t we relax here for a while?”\\n\\n“I am hearing for the first time that you are tired. Yes, you should be, my Lord,\\nfor you were caught under the horse for a long time.”\\n\\n\\x0c“That’s nothing. More than my body, my mind is tired. Should we go back in the\\nway we came and join those idiots? Why don’t we cross the lake and go to the\\nother bank?”\\n\\n“My God! How can we swim across this lake which resembles an ocean? After\\nsaving me from the boar you want to have me killed in this lake?”\\n\\n“I now remember - you can’t swim. I too can’t swim across such a huge lake. If\\nwe get a boat it’d be easy. Didn’t we see a boat a little while ago? It must be\\nsomewhere near on this bank. Why don’t we go look for it?”\\n\\n“Our horses? Should we leave them as prey for the wild animals of the forest?”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan first spoke in a teasing tone. Then he remembered something\\nand stood up startled.\\n\\n“OH MY GOD! WHERE THE HELL IS THE LEOPARD?”\\n\\n“It has completely slipped from my mind. It should be hiding somewhere. The\\nLord of Death might come in the form of a leopard as well. To kill me here.”\\n\\nThe two men looked around. Vandhiya Thevan shouted after some time.\\n“There!”\\n\\n\\x0cThere was a canal which fed water into the lake. The canal became gradually\\nnarrow as it approached the lake. In the narrow section of the canal a tree had\\nfallen and it kind of acted as a bridge between the two banks of the canal. The\\nleopard was walking over the fallen tree.\\n\\nThe same thought flashed in the minds of both the men.\\n\\n“My God! The women in the boat!” The two men shouted simultaneously.\\n\\n“They must have got down at the island near the canal.” - Vandhiya Thevan.\\n\\n“Wounded leopards are very dangerous.”\\n\\n“Let’s kill the leopard and take it along with the boar.”\\n\\n“How can we cross this canal? We can walk over the fallen tree; but not our\\nhorses.”\\n\\n“There is not much water flowing in the canal. We can get down and walk\\nthrough the canal along with the horses.”\\n\\nMeanwhile Karikalan’s horse had gone near Vandhiya Thevan’s horse. It\\nappeared as if the horses, like their Masters, were exchanging notes in their own\\nhorse language about the dangers they faced. The men mounted on the horses.\\nThey led the horses to the canal. The water level was low. But it was quite\\n\\n\\x0cmuddy. The horses had a hard time crossing the canal.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan thought of the quick sand in Kodikkarai. “Compared to those\\ndeath traps this is a breeze.” He described them to the Crown Prince.\\n\\n“My dear friend! You are worried about the quick sand outside. What do you\\nthink of the mud in the minds of people? If someone gets caught in the quick\\nsand of evil thoughts it will be very difficult for him to come out of it.”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan pitied the Prince. Poor soul, his mind was muddy as the canal,\\nhe thought.\\n\\nThe horses reached the other bank of the canal after a great deal of trouble. The\\ntwo men looked carefully in all the directions before riding on. Karikalan was\\nready with his bow and arrows. Vandhiya Thevan was ready to throw the spear\\non the leopard.\\n\\nSuddenly a woman’s shrill voice was heard over the usual sounds of the forest “Amma! Leopard! Danger! Amma! Leopard!”\\n\\nWhen Manimekalai saw the leopard on the tree branch one of the maids who\\nwas cooking in the Mandapam also saw the animal and shrieked. The two men\\nheard the noise. Their hairs stood straight. They rode fast in the direction of the\\nvoice. As soon as they negotiated the turn they were shocked by what they saw.\\n\\nNandini and Manimekalai were climbing down the steps to bath in the lake. At\\n\\n\\x0cthe same time the leopard was slowly climbing up the branches of the tree. The\\nleopard was badly hurt in its fight with the wild boar. Survival should have been\\ntopmost in the mind of the jungle cat. But nobody else knew what was in its\\nmind.\\n\\nKarikalan and Vandhiya Thevan thought that the leopard was going to pounce on\\nthe two women soon.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan was hesitant to use the spear. If it missed the mark and fell on\\nthe ladies.... it might kill them. Karikalan was not hesitant. He loaded his bow\\nwith an arrow and aimed a shot at the leopard. The arrow landed on the leopard’s\\nstomach. The leopard roared and pounced on the two women. Nobody knew\\nwhat happened. The leopard and the two women were not to be seen.\\n\\nA few minutes later all three appeared in different places in the lake. A part of\\nthe lake became red mixed with blood.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 44 - Love And Revenge\\n\\nThe friends watched the events unfolding before them with a sense of awe and\\nwonder. They jumped off their horses. They came running to the banks of the\\nlake. By that time the leopard had gone deeper into the water. From the way the\\nleopard floated on the surface of water it was clear that it was dead. The men\\nbadly wanted to know if the women were hurt. The two men sprang into the\\nwater and went in search of the women.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan was cautious. He swam towards Manimekalai. He was afraid\\nof going near Nandini. Manimekalai was not hurt. She had fallen into water\\nbecause of the shock caused by the leopard’s sudden fall. As her fall was quite\\nsudden she was gasping for breath. She was not hurt. When she saw Vandhiya\\nThevan coming near her she became ecstatic and closed her eyes unable to\\ncontrol her happiness.\\n\\nHence she did not know that Karikalan stopped Vandhiya Thevan by holding his\\nhands and asked him to go towards Nandini. Karikalan now swam towards\\nManimekalai. Poor girl, Manimekalai, she did not open her eyes till Karikalan\\nhugged her, lifted her and then carried her to the shore and gently placed her\\ndown. Only when the Crown Prince placed his fingers beneath her nose to check\\nwhether she was breathing she slowly opened her eyes. She thought that her\\nsaviour was her beloved Vandhiya Thevan. And she tried her best to express all\\nher love and gratitude through her first glance. The moment she recognized the\\nCrown Prince she stood up and moved away from him.\\n\\nThe obvious disappointment in her face did not escape the attention of the\\nCrown Prince. He laughed.\\n\\n\\x0c“What is this Manimekalai? Why do you hate me so much?”\\n\\n“No. I don’t hate you, Prince. How can a girl not feel shy when some stranger\\ntouches her?”\\n\\n“Silly girl! You have made me a stranger. Don’t you know that your people are\\nplanning to get us married?”\\n\\n“Till their plans materialize you will be a stranger to me.”\\n\\n“But you can tell me whether you like this alliance or not.”\\n\\nThe Princess of Kadambur thought for a while.\\n\\n“Your Highness! You are a descendant of the famous Chozha clan. You know the\\nways of the world. Tell me whether it is proper to talk like this to a small girl?\\nShouldn’t you talk to my father?”\\n\\n“Listen Girl, if your father agrees, will you?”\\n\\n“If my father agrees to the match and then he asks me I’ll give a suitable answer\\nto him. I feel very shy to talk to you on this subject. You saved me from the\\nleopard. You saved me from drowning. As an expression of gratitude I have been\\npatient till now.”\\n\\n\\x0cKarikalan laughed again.\\n\\n“Manimekalai, you are very smart. You are a deep person. Even then you are\\ndisappointed. But don’t try to deceive me.”\\n\\n“Oh My God! What are you talking, Your Highness! How can a small girl like\\nme deceive the Crown Prince? What for? And pray, how?”\\n\\n“Why are you beating around the bush? If Vandhiya Thevan had carried you\\nashore instead of me will you be using the same harsh words against him? You\\nclosed your eyes thinking that Vandhiya Thevan is coming to save you. You\\nopened your eyes hoping to see only him. And poor girl, you were\\ndisappointed.”\\n\\nManimekalai was shy at first. And then afraid. She took some time to gather\\nherself.\\n\\n“Prince, you know what is in my mind. Then why are you still testing the\\nwaters?”\\n\\n“Manimekalai, I know what’s in your mind. I also know what’s in Vandhiya\\nThevan’s mind as well. I think that Vandhiya Thevan does not deserve your love.\\nSee there. Vandhiya Thevan and Nandini are playing games of love. See the\\nhappiness in Nandini’s face.”\\n\\n\\x0cManimekalai looked in the direction pointed out by the Crown Prince.\\nManimekalai’s mind which was as white as milk till then was poisoned by\\nfeelings of envy.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan and Nandini were in conversation. The leopard’s claw had hurt\\nNandini’s shoulders. She was bleeding. But unlike Manimekalai Nandini did not\\nmake any attempt to close her eyes. She did not take any effort to free herself\\nfrom the hands of Vandhiya Thevan. But Vandhiya Thevan felt as if he were\\ncarrying a live flame and was in a hurry to let her down. Nandini had remained\\nin water for some time. And yet her body was hot.\\n\\nA vague fear crept into the mind of Vandhiya Thevan. He was shivering. Nandini\\nsmiled.\\n\\n“Why are you trembling in fear? Did you mistake me for the leopard? Or\\nperhaps you wanted to save the leopard; and by mistake you saved me. A case of\\nmistaken identity. I hope you are regretting your decision.”\\n\\n“Please, Devi, please don’t use harsh words on me. I am shaken because I was\\nforced to touch you and carry you.”\\n\\n“Guilty minds get shaken. That’s the rule.”\\n\\n“I am innocent, Devi.”\\n\\n“Are you sure? You sought my help to get into Thanjavur Fort. I gave my signet\\n\\n\\x0cring to you. Then you entered my private chambers by stealth. I saved you from\\nnear death. And pray, how did you repay your gratitude? You ran away from me.\\nYou simply vanished without caring to take leave of me. You promised to come\\nto me after meeting the Princess at Pazhaiyaarai. And you went back on your\\nword. Do you still consider yourself innocent?”\\n\\n“Yes, I accept the charges levelled against me. But I have my reasons, Devi. I am\\nafter all a paid servant. I am bound by the orders of Adithya Karikalan. And if\\nyou consider my circumstances you’ll never accuse me, Devi.”\\n\\n“Yes. Even to save a woman from the mouth of a leopard you need to have the\\norders of your Boss, Karikalan. I was watching. The Prince showed an unusual\\ninterest in rescuing Manimekalai. I think he would have been glad if I had\\ndrowned. And without knowing what is there in the mind of your employer you\\nhave saved me.”\\n\\n“Please, Devi. Please don’t talk like that. The Crown Prince has come all the\\nway from Kanchi because of the message you sent to him.”\\n\\n“But you came running to block his coming here. You came with a message\\nfrom Princess Kunthavai. But you failed in your grand mission. Remember\\nwhenever you interfere with my work it will be a failure for you.”\\n\\nNandini’s words confused Vandhiya Thevan. He was dying to know the real\\nmeaning of her words. So he examined her face for clues. Nandini’s face was\\ndevoid of any expression but for her usual bland smile.\\n\\nNandini continued.\\n\\n\\x0c“Your guilt is evident from your face. On that fateful New Moon night you were\\ncaught by my men. If I had half-winked my eyes you would have been killed in\\nno time. I forgot the past and did my best to save you. And you never cared to\\nthank me for that that. I’ve never seen such an ungrateful creature on earth.”\\n\\n“I promise, Devi, my heart is full of gratitude for you.”\\n\\n“I have been in this town for several days. And you never met me even once to\\nexpress that gratitude. How can I believe you?”\\n\\n“I thought of meeting you in person to convey the feelings of gratitude. But,\\nDevi, the circumstances were not favourable.”\\n\\n“You did not do anything to create favourable circumstances. You could have at\\nleast given me a sign, a glance, a look or some signal. You never did that. You\\nnever even turned to look at me.”\\n\\n“Devi, you are the wife of Chancellor of Exchequer of the Chozha Kingdom.”\\n\\n“Now you are teasing me. You are insinuating that I am married to an old man!”\\n\\n“Not at all, Devi. If I tease you I’ll go to hell.”\\n\\n\\x0c“No need for that now. Whatever it is don’t mention that I am the wife of\\nPazhuvettaraiyar. I am not his wife.”\\n\\n“Oh My God! What are you saying?”\\n\\n“Nothing but the bitter truth. If a girl is forcibly abducted and brought home will\\nshe become the abductor’s wife by default?”\\n\\n“Devi, you are a girl from Tamilnadu. I am sure you won’t do anything that goes\\nagainst the rules of virtue applicable to women.”\\n\\n“Yes, I know those rules. If a Tamil woman loses her heart to a man she will\\nconsider him and only him as her husband. A forced marriage will never bind\\nher.”\\n\\n“But ... but... you... Devi... “\\n\\n“I know what you are coming to. How did I consent to a forced marriage with\\nPazhuvettaraiyar? It was for an important reason. There is another special trait of\\nTamilnadu women. They will never rest till they have avenged the injustice\\nmeted out to them. You did not help me to find my love; please help me at least\\nto seek revenge.”\\n\\nNandini’s last words tore Vandhiya Thevan’s heart. He felt as if he had been hit\\nby a lightning. He was in a state of shock.\\n\\n\\x0c“Devi! Devi! What is this? What is the connection between me and your love?\\nWhat is the connection between love and revenge?”\\n\\n“There is a connection. But right now I don’t have the time to explain. See there.\\nThe Prince and Manimekalai are coming towards us. If you come to my room by\\nmidnight tomorrow I’ll tell you everything.”\\n\\n“How it is possible, Devi? You are in the highly guarded ladies’ chamber. How\\ncan I come there alone? And that too at midnight?”\\n\\n“Didn’t you escape from the same ladies chambers once? Why can’t you use the\\nsame way? Of course only if you want to; only if you have the will to come.”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan was in a state of perfect shock now. But Nandini’s face did not\\nshow any expression other than her usual seductive smile.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 45 - “You Are My Sister”\\n\\nKarikalan and Manimekalai reached Vandhiya Thevan and Nandini.\\n\\nThe Prince was looking at Vandhiya Thevan till he reached the place. Only then\\ndid he see Nandini. He saw red lines on her cheek and shoulder. He saw blood.\\n\\n“Oh My God! Were you hurt by the bloody leopard?”\\n\\n“Yes, Your Highness. But the damned animal could only hurt my body. Not my\\nmind.”\\n\\nThe words went deep into the heart of the Crown Prince. Before he could\\nrespond Manimekalai went near Nandini and spoke with trepidation.\\n\\n“Yes, Akka! The wounds appear deep. Thank God, I have brought some\\nointment. Come with me. I’ll apply it. You will be fine soon.”\\n\\n“My dearest sister, I am used to being hurt. I have sustained much deeper\\nwounds which have healed in the course of time. But tell me do you have any\\nointment for the wounds in one’s heart.”\\n\\n“Sure, Akka. I do have. Come with me.” Manimekalai held Nandini’s hand and\\n\\n\\x0cvirtually dragged her to the Mandapam.\\n\\nThe Prince and Vandhiya Thevan followed them maintaining a respectable\\ndistance. They sat on a marble bench beneath a huge mango tree near the\\nMandapam.\\n\\n“Prince, the sooner we get out of this place the better for us. If we stay here any\\nlonger Kandhanmaran or his father might think ill of us.”\\n\\n“Let them think whatever they want to. They cannot kill us for this indiscretion,\\nright? It is enough if these women do not think ill of us. Let’s wait till they come\\nback. We’ll take leave of them and go.”\\n\\nA few minutes later Nandini and Manimekalai returned. They had changed.\\nNandini’s wounds were covered by a dark paste.\\n\\n“We are waiting to take leave of you.”\\n\\n“It’s late in the afternoon. Having come thus far and having saved us from\\ndanger it is but proper that you should have lunch with us. If I let you go then\\nSambuvaraiyar’s daughter will never forgive me.”\\n\\n“We’ll stay but on one condition. Manimekalai has applied some ointment on\\nyour wounds. She told me that she had some ointment for the wounds of the\\nheart as well. If you promise to tell us about that magical ointment we’ll stay\\nback. “\\n\\n\\x0c“Why should we ask her? Can’t we make a guess?”\\n\\n“Perhaps she talks of time which kind of heals all the wounds in the heart.”\\n\\n“No, it can’t be. There are some wounds which even time can’t heal.”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan intervened.\\n\\n“There is an excellent ointment for women. That’s called tears.”\\n\\nNandini retorted.\\n\\n“The Prince of Vallam was perhaps waiting for an opportunity to insult women.\\nBut what he says is not right. With some kind of wounds women even lose their\\ncapacity to shed tears. Then how will it be useful as a medicine?”\\n\\n“Well, Devi, if you think we are not right, tell us what you think is right.”\\n\\n“Why not? My dear sister, the ointment you referred goes to the heart through\\none’s ears. I am sure you allude to music that comes from Yazh, the flute and\\nfrom a sweet human voice. Am I right?”\\n\\n\\x0c“You are, Akka. But how did you know?”\\n\\n“Didn’t I tell you that I am a sorceress? I have magical powers. I can divine what\\nis there in the mind of others. But, do you two accept the power of music to heal\\nthe wounds in one’s heart?”\\n\\n“We do. I also accept my defeat in not being able to guess that. I now remember\\nwhat Kandhanmaran told about his sister Manimekalai - that she can play the\\nYazh very well.”\\n\\n“That is how a brother should be. Unless he sings the praises of his sister at least\\nonce the day is wasted for him. Yes, whatever he says about Manimekalai’s\\nmusical talents is true. She has brought the instrument with her. Thank God she\\nis not forced to display her talents before somebody like me - you know I am\\nalmost stone-deaf. Gentlemen, you saved us from being devoured by the leopard.\\nPlease give us an opportunity to express our gratitude. You should have lunch\\nwith us. And stay with us to enjoy Princess Manimekalai’s musical\\nperformance.”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan gave a secret signal to the Crown Prince not to accept the\\ninvitation. But the Crown Prince did not notice him at all.\\n\\n“We are ready to do whatever the Princesses want us to do.” - The Crown Prince\\nwas enthusiastic.\\n\\n“Manimekalai, your dream has come true. Please have a look at the cooking\\narrangements. You have to hasten your cooks. We can’t keep these men waiting\\nfor long.”\\n\\n\\x0cManimekalai ran towards the place where the maids were busy cooking.\\nVandhiya Thevan stood up and looked around.\\n\\nNandini saw him.\\n\\n“Didn’t I tell you that I have the powers to divine what’s there in others’ minds?\\nI want to test my powers now. Shall I tell you what’s going on in the mind of the\\nVallam Prince?”\\n\\nKarikalan smiled at her.\\n\\n“Please.”\\n\\n“He thinks that it was a great blunder to have killed the leopard and saved these\\ntwo women. He thinks it would have been much better if we two had gone into\\nthe leopard’s stomach.”\\n\\nKarikalan laughed.\\n\\n“My dear friend, is she right?”\\n\\n“No, Your Highness. I never thought like that. But I have to give it to this noble\\nlady that I was thinking about the leopard and these two women. I was\\n\\n\\x0cwondering how the leopard managed to live after being caught by these\\nwomen.”\\n\\n“What happened to you, Thambi? Why are you blabbering? Is it alive? Again?\\nDidn’t we see the dead body floating on water?”\\n\\nThe Crown Prince stood up.\\n\\n“Look there, Your Highness.”\\n\\nFrom where they stood they could see the water-body between the branches of\\nthe trees. The boat used by the women was tied to the tree. The leopard was\\ntrying to get into the boat.\\n\\nKarikalan smiled as he spoke.\\n\\n“Aha! The leopard has a strong will. Looks like it is not destined to die.”\\n\\n“Come, Prince, let’s go and kill the leopard. A wounded leopard is dangerous.”\\n\\n“Brave Warrior of the Vana Clan, does a wounded leopard require two great\\nwarriors? I’ll call Manimekalai. She has a small knife in her hand. And that is\\nmore than enough to kill the beast.”\\n\\n\\x0c“See my friend, the Queen of Pazhuvur has high regards for our valour. Do you\\nthink I should also come along? Aren’t you enough?”\\n\\n“Or shall I send Manimekalai?” - Nandini asked.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan murmured:\\n\\n“Yes, you can send her. But the problem is that she might apply some ointment\\nand revive the animal. “\\n\\n“What are you thinking?” The Crown Prince asked Vandhiya Thevan.\\n\\n“I am thinking of bringing the head of the wounded leopard and place it at the\\nfeet of the Pazhuvur Queen. Let me see at least if that makes her happy.”\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan walked away with these words.\\n\\n“Did you hear what the ruffian said? Do you think it requires much valour to\\nbehead a wounded leopard?”\\n\\nKarikalan started to laugh at his own joke. He stopped after seeing the\\nexpression on Nandini’s face.\\n\\n\\x0c“You are the best person to give an opinion on that.” Nandini’s words were very\\nsharp. She probably alluded to the Crown Prince beheading Veerapandiyan when\\nhe was wounded and helpless.\\n\\nKarikalan told her in a choked voice.\\n\\n“Nandini I came here only because you sent message through Kandhanmaran.\\nOtherwise I would not have come at all.”\\n\\n“You acceded to my request at least now. Thanks a lot.”\\n\\n“I thought that you had forgotten the past. And that was why you invited me\\nhere.”\\n\\n“How can I forget the past, Prince? Tell me have you forgotten?”\\n\\n“Yes, I too can’t. You were in tears. You begged a boon from me. I brutally\\nrefused. I was in a state of frenzy at that time. No, I have not forgotten anything.\\nBut tell me why did you ask me to come here?”\\n\\n“Prince, you have not visited Thanjavur for the past three years. You have not\\nseen your sick father.”\\n\\n“He is not only my father but... “\\n\\n\\x0c“Yes, I know. He is also the father of Princess Kunthavai as well as Ponniyin\\nSelvan. But your father misses you a lot. Somebody has told the Emperor that I\\nam the reason for your not coming to the capital. The Emperor hates me because\\nof that and has not seen me even once. You have done enough harm to me,\\nPrince. Why do you want to add this blame also to my account?”\\n\\n“But that is the truth. I did not come to Thanjavur because of you.”\\n\\n“Then let me leave Thanjavur immediately. You come to the town, become the\\nnext Emperor and... “\\n\\n“That will never happen, Nandini. I am not keen on the Chozha Throne. Let\\nMadhuranthakan be crowned the King. Let him rule the Kingdom.”\\n\\n“Prince, you know Madhuranthakan very well. He cannot govern this huge\\nEmpire.”\\n\\n“So what? The Pazhuvettaraiyars are ready and willing to help him. And you are\\nthere as well.”\\n\\n“I now know what’s in your mind. Let me go out of Pazhuvur Palace. Let me go\\nout of Thanjavur. You please come... “\\n\\n“No! No! Not at all! You got me all wrong. I don’t have any desire to become\\nthe King. I have done enough harm to you in the past. I am not planning to hurt\\n\\n\\x0cyou anymore. Let me not drive you out of the Pazhuvur Palace and add that to\\nthe list of heinous sins I have committed against you.”\\n\\n“Prince, why can’t we both live in Thanjavur? That is a large town. Don’t you\\nthink there will not be enough room for both of us in the capital city? Ok, there\\nis no need for us to meet.”\\n\\n“Yes, there may not be any necessity for us to meet. But how are we going to\\navoid the thoughts in our mind? You told me a little while ago that you can’t\\nforget the past. You also spoke about the wound in your heart. I too have a\\nwound in my heart. And I can’t forget the past.”\\n\\n“You may not be able to forget; can’t you at least forgive? Can’t you forgive\\nme?”\\n\\n“Nandini, you never did anything which requires my forgiveness. I was the one\\nwho wronged you. I am the one who should seek your forgiveness. Even when I\\nleft Kanchi I had the idea of seeking your pardon. But what I heard on the way\\nmade me totally unfit even to be pardoned by you.”\\n\\n“My Lord, your seeking my pardon... well that’s not in any way fit or proper.\\nYou are the first born of the Emperor. I am after all an orphan, a child abandoned\\nby her parents.”\\n\\n“No, Nandini. You are not an orphan.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Yes, the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar was kind enough to accept me as his wife.\\nEven then..... “\\n\\n“Not only that, Nandini. I don’t know how I am going to tell this to you... “\\n\\n“You can tell anything to this inane girl. You need not have any reservation.\\nEven those who are just roaming on the streets have something to tell me. They\\ngo out of the way to insult me.”\\n\\n“Nandini, from now on if anybody insults you I can’t be patient. You need to just\\ntell me. I will punish the person who dares to insult you.”\\n\\n“You have been affectionate to me right from the beginning. You have even\\nfought with the Pazhaiyaarai Princess on my behalf. She is your sister, my\\nLord.”\\n\\n“Nandini you too are my sister like Kunthavai. I am your brother.”\\n\\n“My Lord, since I have become somebody’s wife you are treating me like your\\nsister. That is something befitting to your lineage. But how can I consider the\\nEmperor’s son, the one who is born to rule the whole world as my brother?”\\n\\n“You have not understood me, Nandini. You are really my sister. You are the\\nEmperor’s daughter.”\\n\\n\\x0cNandini laughed as if she heard a joke.\\n\\n“Are you all right, Prince? Or have I gone insane? I don’t know.”\\n\\n“I am sane. So are you.”\\n\\n“Then why are you teasing an orphan?”\\n\\n“Look at my eyes, Nandini. Do I look like a person who will tease you?”\\n\\n“Look at my eyes, Prince. Do I look like the Emperor’s daughter? Do I have any\\nof the royal signs on my face?”\\n\\n“Nandini, I have been seeing your face since you were five. I have always been\\nmesmerized by the radiant beauty of your face. I know the reason for it only\\nnow. Only on my way from Kanchi did I know the reason for your unusual\\nbeauty. Amongst the women married in the Chozha clan there is no one equal to\\nthe beauty of Kalyani, daughter of Vaithumbarayan. Her beauty is world famous.\\nShe is my grandmother. She is still alive. She lives in Pazhaiyaarai now. At\\nseventy her beauty is still matchless. It is very difficult to look straight into her\\nface. She is so beautiful. All her beauty has taken refuge in you. I don’t have that\\nkind of beauty. Nor does Princess Kunthavai or my brother Arulmozhi. My\\ngrandmother’s beauty has come to you through my father.”\\n\\n“What is that you are talking, Prince? I think I have lost my mind. Or there\\nshould be some problem with my hearing.”\\n\\n\\x0c“No, Nandini. You are all right. Your mind is all right. Your ears are working\\nwell. You are my father’s daughter. That makes you my sister. Before marrying\\nmy mother the Emperor fell in love with a noble lady of Srilanka and married\\nher. You are her daughter. And hence my sister.”\\n\\nKarikalan was quite enthusiastic.\\n\\nNandini appeared shocked. She was staring at the Crown Prince for a while.\\nThen her face became clear again.\\n\\n“My Lord, is this the news you came to know after you left Kanchi?”\\n\\n“Yes, Nandini. Once I knew that, everything became clear. That information was\\nthe missing piece in the jigsaw puzzle of my life.”\\n\\n“My Lord, who told you that news? Was it by any chance, Vandhiya Thevan?”\\n\\n“You are right. He told me the news. But he did not say that on his own. Princess\\nKunthavai conveyed it through him.”\\n\\n“Now I understand. People have been conspiring to keep us apart from very\\nearly days. Looks like the conspirators are still busy in their avowed mission.”\\n\\n\\x0c“You are wrong, Nandini. There is no conspiracy here. When we were young the\\nQueen Mother struggled hard to keep us apart. At that time I did not understand\\nher actions. In fact I was furious with her. Only now I know that she has saved\\nus from a great disaster. They could have been more transparent. They could\\nhave told us the truth earlier. A great injustice has been meted out to you because\\nthey withheld the truth. They have wronged me as well. Let the past be past. Let\\nus forget it. Even if we cannot forget let us at least forgive them.”\\n\\n“Did Vandhiya Thevan tell you just this or is there something more to the story?”\\n\\n“Why do you use the word ‘story’ Nandini? Don’t you believe that?”\\n\\n“That is not believable, Prince. If I had been born as the Emperor’s daughter\\nwhy should I reach this state? Why did I have to suffer so much? Ok, let it be\\ntrue. I want to know whether he said something else.”\\n\\nKarikalan hesitated. And then poured out everything.\\n\\n“Yes, he also told me that you are now with the conspirators of the Pandya\\nKingdom. And you have taken a vow to destroy the Chozha clan. And that you\\nare worshipping a knife on whose handle there is the fish emblem of the\\nPandyas. He also told me that you crowned a little boy as the Pandya King at the\\nWar Memorial on the banks of Coleroon River. Forget it, Nandini. You too have\\na right to share the glory of the Chozha Kingdom. You are the daughter of the\\nreigning Emperor Sundara Chozhan. You are our dear sister. It will be my first\\nduty to right all the wrongs done to you.”\\n\\n“Lord, do you believe these stories? Then why did you wait for so many days?\\n\\n\\x0cWhy didn’t you try to talk to me earlier?”\\n\\n“I was confused, Nandini. I needed some time to understand this new\\nrelationship. I was also looking for the right time to explain everything to you.\\nThis is not something which I can share with you in the presence of others.\\nThanks to a wild boar and a leopard I got the opportunity today.”\\n\\n“The wild animals are dangerous. But not as dangerous as human beings. I\\nrealise the truth only now.”\\n\\n“Sister, you said earlier that we cannot forget the past. I agreed. I asked you to at\\nleast forgive if you can’t forget what happened in the past. You have not\\nresponded to my request till now.”\\n\\n“My Lord, I’ll forgive whatever you did to me in the past. Perhaps I may forget\\nthem too. But I can never forget or forgive what you did to me today.”\\n\\n“What did I do today? I never betrayed you or let you down.”\\n\\n“I am coming to that. Look at that scoundrel.”\\n\\n“You mean, Vandhiya Thevan?”\\n\\n“Yes. You asked him to come with the head of the Leopard. He is coming empty\\nhanded. He saw me in Thanjavur one day. He told me that if he was touched\\n\\n\\x0ceven by my feet he would consider it a blessing. I did not even want to kick him.\\nI told him I was going to call the guards. He ran away. Because I did not yield to\\nhis lust, he has spun this yarn to you. He promised to bring your head to me if I\\nwanted to. He is afraid that I might share these things with you. That was why he\\nwent out of the way to prevent your coming to Kadambur. And that is why he\\nnever leaves your side. He is a treacherous black guard. I don’t even want to\\ntouch him with my feet. And you made him hug me and touch all over my body\\nand carry me from the lake. And you were seeing that with your own eyes. Now\\ntell me can I ever forget this? Or even forgive?”\\n\\nNandini’s eyes had gone red. She was trembling in anger. After hearing her\\nKarikalan felt giddy. He felt as if the lake, the trees in the forest and the\\nMandapam were all going in circles.\\n\\n“My dear sister, Nandini! Can it be true? I don’t know who I should believe. Can\\nVandhiya Thevan be so wicked? I even thought of getting him married to that\\nsilly girl Manimekalai?”\\n\\n“You need not believe my words, Prince. You always take rash decisions. Please\\ndon’t do that now. Just observe him for two days. You will know.”\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 46 - The Boat Moved Away\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan came towards the Prince and Nandini from one side while\\nManimekalai came from the other. She was almost running towards them\\nrepeating the words “Akka, lunch is served.”\\n\\nKarikalan looked in both the directions.\\n\\n“Nandini, it was not just Vandhiya Thevan who wanted to prevent me from\\ncoming to Kadambur. A Vaishnavite by name Azhwarkkadian too advised me\\nagainst this visit. And to cap it all, the Chief Minister, my father’s best friend and\\na person whom I worship also gave a similar warning.”\\n\\n“Chief Minister Aniruddhar is your father’s best friend. And that’s why he wants\\nto take your father’s life. You worship him. That’s why he wants to be doubly\\nsure that you don’t get the Crown.”\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\n“The Chief Minister thinks you are short tempered and immature. He thinks that\\nyou are an atheist, or at least a person who does not have enough devotion. He\\nhas a long range plan. He wants your brother to ascend the Chozha throne. And\\nthen he will convert him to Vaishnavism. Very soon Vaishnavism will become\\nthe religion of the State. That’s his ambition. But when your brother went\\nmissing on the high seas all his plans were spoiled.”\\n\\n\\x0c“But why should all of them prevent me from coming to Kadambur?”\\n\\n“I am the only one who knows what’s in their minds. They may be afraid that I\\nmight tell you everything.”\\n\\n“How do you know their minds?”\\n\\n“Your Majesty has forgotten the fact that I happen to be the sister of that\\nVaishnavite fanatic Azhwarkkadian.”\\n\\n“Are you really his blood sister? Do you want me to believe that story?”\\n\\n“I never believed that story myself. I don’t want you to believe that either. I grew\\nup in his father’s house. That’s why he calls me his sister. He used to say that I\\nam an incarnation of Andal, one of the twelve Azhwars. He wants me to go with\\nhim from place to place singing the compositions of Azhwars and spread\\nVaishnavism.”\\n\\n“Did he want to make you a Vaishnavite Nun like there are nuns in Buddhism?”\\n\\n“No, it’s worse. He wanted to marry me. And wanted to travel around as a\\ncouple singing devotional songs. He also wanted me to bear many children for\\nhim all with a view to propagate Vaishnavism.”\\n\\n“Oh My God! Where is that monkey-face Thirumalai and where are you? Did he\\n\\n\\x0creally want to marry you?”\\n\\n“That’s my bad luck, Prince. Perhaps I was born at an inauspicious time. Any\\nman who comes near me does so only with a lustful motive.”\\n\\n“Why do you want to accuse all men simply because of what the old man\\nPazhuvettaraiyar did to you?”\\n\\n“Lord, I beg you; please don’t talk ill of Pazhuvettaraiyar in my presence. He fell\\nin love with me. And he married me. It was a lawful wedding. He made an\\norphan girl his Queen. He made me live in a palace and enjoy the royal\\nprivileges.”\\n\\n“But what do you want, Nandini? Do you really love him? Have you really\\naccepted him as your husband? Then. .. . then... ”\\n\\n“No! I am deeply indebted to him. That’s all. It’s just gratitude and nothing\\nmore. We are not living as man and wife. Prince, you should understand that I\\nwas born in a poor family and was abandoned by my parents. I gave my heart\\nonly to one man. I will never take it back or give it to another.”\\n\\n“Who is that lucky fellow, Nandini? No, you need not answer that question. But\\nanswer this - who are you? If you are not my father’s daughter, if you are not my\\nsister, and if you are not Azhwarkkadian’s sister, then who are you? I’ll be\\ngrateful if you just answer this question, Nandini. Please. If I don’t know the\\nanswer to that question I am afraid I’ll lose my mind.”\\n\\n\\x0c“I am dying to tell you, Prince. But see your friend and my friend have come\\nvery near. I’ll tell you when we meet next.”\\n\\nNandini spoke to Vandhiya Thevan who had reached them:\\n\\n“What is this? Your hands are empty? What happened to the leopard’s head?”\\n\\n“Devi, I am not fortunate enough to place the head of leopard at your feet.”\\n\\n“Is this valour? You used to sing songs about your ancestors. You used to sing\\nthat your forefathers planted the heads of the Three Great Kings, the Cheras,\\nChozhas and Pandyas on the field instead of paddy saplings.”\\n\\n“What is that song?” - The Crown Prince was curious.\\n\\n“Are you going to speak or shall I do it for you?” - There was sarcasm in\\nNandini’s voice.\\n\\n“Devi, I don’t remember telling you about such a song.”\\n“You have forgotten. But I have not. Listen.\\nMaking the fallen army a natural manure\\nWith their flowing blood doing the function of water\\nIn the field of dirt ploughed by the elephant\\n\\n\\x0cThe Vaana King, the best of Royal blood\\nPlanted the heads of the three emperors\\nThe Cheras, the Chozhas and the Pandyas.\\nNandini was in a devastating mood at that time.\\n\\n“My Lord, how is the song? You beheaded just the Pandya King. But this man’s\\nancestors plucked the heads of all the three emperors and planted them in their\\nfield as if they were saplings.”\\n\\nNandini succeeded eminently in her mission for there was fury and disgust on\\nthe face of the Crown Prince.\\n\\n“ Great planting! Great farming! ” And then he broke out into a loud laugh more\\nto hide his disgust.\\n\\nVandhiya Thevan did not have the courage to face his employer. He had to take\\nenormous efforts to steady himself\\n\\nHe spoke to Nandini in a hesitant voice:\\n\\n“Devi, I have never talked about that song to you.”\\n\\n“So what? If you don’t know about the glory of your ancestors it’s time to learn.\\nHaving come from a clan which used the heads of emperors as saplings in a\\n\\n\\x0cfarm you can’t bring the head of a wounded leopard. Shame on you!”\\n\\n“What can I do, Devi? The wounded leopard is dead. I don’t want to behead a\\ndead leopard.”\\n\\n“How did that happen? I saw the beast slowly getting into the boat.” The Prince\\nwas surprised.\\n\\n“It was I who showed that to you, my Lord. It got into the boat, lay down and\\nthen died peacefully. Perhaps it would have felt guilty that it had hurt the Junior\\nQueen of Pazhuvur.”\\n\\nThe Crown Prince cooled down.\\n\\n“It could have died in water. Why did it get into the boat?”\\n\\n“Perhaps, it’s also like me, Your Highness. Afraid of water. Of all the ways of\\ndying I dread dying in water.”\\n\\n“But a short while ago you jumped courageously into water? Perhaps you have\\nso much of compassion for this silly girl.” Nandini was not yet finished.\\n\\n“Devi, honestly, I am more afraid of women than water. I jumped in because the\\nPrince ordered me to do so. Only now do I realise that I need not have jumped at\\nall.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Yes, yes. Now I remember. You are afraid of falling in water. You are never\\nafraid of pushing somebody into water and drowning them.”\\n\\nNandini was cleverly alluding to the drowning accident involving\\nArulmozhivarman.\\n\\nManimekalai did not like the way the conversation went. And that clearly\\nshowed in her face.\\n\\n“Akka, the food is getting cold. Come let’s go.”\\n\\nAll the four started to walk towards the Mandapam. Manimekalai stole a few\\nglances at Vandhiya Thevan. She knew intuitively that Vandhiya Thevan was in\\ntrouble and that the Prince and Nandini were somehow the reason for it.\\n\\n“Let the whole world oppose you. I’ll be on your side, my dear. Don’t ever\\nworry.”\\n\\nShe wanted to tell these words through her eyes if only Vandhiya Thevan looked\\nat her. But Vandhiya Thevan did not look at her even once. He was lost in his\\nown world of grief.\\n\\nNandini’s treacherous words, the great charge she levelled on Vandhiya Thevan\\nmust have shocked and repulsed any sensitive being. That is quite natural. But if\\nanyone cares to know a little more about her he would not be shocked.\\n\\n\\x0cThe qualities of a man or woman largely depend on heredity. They are also\\ngreatly influenced by habits and circumstances. Mandhakini, a dumb and deaf\\nwoman, lived mostly in the forests. She had to be extremely careful for she was\\nvirtually living with the wild animals. At times she had to mercilessly kill those\\nanimals to save her life.\\n\\nHer mind was as pure as the milk for a long time. And then the sweet elixir of\\nlove was added to that milk when she met her first and only love in her life,\\nSundara Chozhan. But soon the fountain of love went dry and her life became as\\ndry as a desert. She was disappointed when Destiny played a cruel game in her\\nlife. The shock was so much for her that at one point of time she almost lost her\\nsanity.\\n\\nBut as time passed on, the wounds in her heart healed. Love came into her life\\nfor the second time. The enormous love she had for Sundara Chozhan soon\\nevolved into a motherly love for his son, Arulmozhivarman.\\n\\nNandini was Mandhakini’s daughter. She inherited almost all the traits of her\\nmother. But the world was even harsher to the daughter than the mother. Nandini\\nwas abandoned at birth by her mother. She grew up in a stranger’s house. She\\nsuffered more from human beings than her mother, from the wild animals of the\\nforest. When she was insulted and ridiculed by the children of the Royal family,\\nher heart hardened. All her ill-feelings crystallized into hatred - harder than a\\nrock and more lethal than the world’s deadliest poison. If only she had had some\\nlove in her life the hatred in her mind would have been to that extent diluted. She\\nnever had it.\\n\\nWhosoever loved her either ignored and insulted her or died all of a sudden and\\nvanished from her life.\\n\\n\\x0cThose who insulted her and those who were hated by her lived a glorious life.\\nWhat else is needed to make a girl’s mind turn into poison? The only feeling that\\nfilled up her mind was a thirst for revenge against those who hated and insulted\\nher. She had a natural ability to scheme - something she had even when she was\\nin her mother’s womb.\\n\\nHer life was full of disappointments and grief thanks to which all soft feelings\\nhad died an early and inglorious death in her heart. And her heart was as hard as\\nthe galvanised steel. Without understanding Nandini’s mind it is almost\\nimpossible to follow the story line.\\n\\nThe four people had their lunch in relative silence. It was a kind of picnic lunch\\nand a happy conversation should have accompanied it. But it did not. Nandini,\\nKarikalan and Vandhiya Thevan were lost in their own personal thoughts and\\ngrief. Manimekalai was the one who suffered the most. She loved Nandini. And\\nshe had made elaborate arrangements for the picnic and the lunch only to spend\\nsome happy time with the Pazhuvur Queen and play some water-games with her.\\nWhen the Prince and Vandhiya Thevan unexpectedly joined the party at first she\\nwas excited. But then she was put off by the way the three people talked and\\nbehaved with respect to one another.\\n\\nManimekalai was gifted with the mind of an innocent child. She soon forgot\\nseeing Vandhiya Thevan holding Nandini in his hand. She even regretted the\\nmomentary feelings of jealousy that passed her mind when she saw them\\ntogether.\\n\\nBut she could never understand the not so happy conversation among those three\\npeople and the frown in their faces. She did not understand their conversation let\\nalone like it.\\n\\n\\x0cA few minutes after lunch Manimekalai spoke to Nandini in a listless voice:\\n\\n“Akka, shall we go back? Shall I ask the boat to be brought in? Are these people\\ncoming with us?”\\n\\nKarikalan was shaken from his reverie.\\n\\n“Aha! How can we go back without listening to this girl’s music concert? Never.\\nNandini, have you forgotten or what? Manimekalai, we have been waiting to\\nlisten to you. Please don’t disappoint us.”\\n\\nNandini spoke for both.\\n\\n“No, Prince, I have not forgotten that. But you and your friend do not seem to be\\nin a mood to enjoy music. You look as if you are standing on a sharp thorn and\\nin a hurry to go. It’s all right. Manimekalai, please bring your Yazh.”\\n\\n“Why should I Akka? Why do you force me to play music before those who do\\nnot like it?”\\n\\n“No, no! Didn’t you hear the Prince? He is eager to listen to your performance.\\nAnd if his friend doesn’t like music let him close his ears.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Oh My God! I don’t hate music. A boat-woman by name Poonkuzhali sang a\\nbeautiful song. I become ecstatic when I think of that song:\\n\\nWhen the sea is still and so is the wave\\nWhy should the inner sea rant and rave\\nWhen the earth-maid is asleep\\nWhy should the heart be restless and weep”\\n\\n“Some people prefer to hear the songs sung by a chosen few. I am not sure\\nwhether you’ll like mine.”\\n\\nKarikalan pacified her.\\n\\n“I’ll make him listen to your music, Manimekalai. I stand guarantee for Vandhya\\nThevan. Now be a good girl and bring your Yazh.”\\n\\nManimekalai obeyed. She sat on the top step of the Mandapam. She tightened\\nthe strings in the instrument and set the harmony. The instrument had seven\\nstrings. Each string could play two notes. For a while Manimekalai played the\\nstringed instrument and filled the place with melodious music. Music in a way\\nwas a kind of powerful magic for within a few seconds Karikalan and Vandhya\\nThevan forgot all their problems. For a while there was nothing in their hearts\\nexcept Manimekalai’s music.\\n\\nAnd then Manimekalai sang. At first she confined herself only to some\\ndevotional numbers especially the compositions of Saivite saints like\\n\\n\\x0cThirunavukkarasar and Sundara Murthi Nayanar. The Prince then expressed his\\ndesire:\\n\\n“Manimekalai your songs are out of the world. But why do you confine yourself\\nto just devotional numbers? You know very well I am not into too much of\\ndevotion and spirituality. Whatever devotion to Lord Shiva I had I have given up\\nin favour of my uncle Madhuranthakan. Why don’t you sing a love song for\\nme?”\\n\\nManimekalai’s beautiful cheeks turned blood red. She was a little hesitant. The\\nPrince tried his best to assuage her feelings.\\n\\n“Why do you hesitate, girl? Well, if you sing a love song, I won’t think that you\\nhave me in your mind. Nor my friend here will have such wrong notions. So\\nplease go ahead and sing, Manimekalai.”\\n\\nNandini was quick to intervene.\\n\\n“Even if somebody thinks that she sings only for him, Manimekalai would not\\nbother.”\\n\\n“Akka! Why are you teasing me in the presence of these men?”\\n\\n“The mistake is not in me, Manimekalai. It’s in your thinking. You think that\\nthese two people are men. That is fundamentally wrong. How can you consider\\nsomebody who cannot even bring the head of a dead leopard as a man? In the\\n\\n\\x0cgood old days the warriors of Tamilnadu used to catch a tiger alive, open its\\nmouth, extricate its teeth and make it as a jewel for their beloved. Those days are\\nall gone. Let’s not worry about that now. You sing, Manimekalai. You sang a\\nsong to me the other day. That was beautiful. Why don’t you sing that song for\\nthese people?”\\n\\nManimekalai played the Yazh and sang simultaneously. When she sang of love\\nthere was an additional dose of sweetness in her voice. The rendering was very\\nsoft but very touching.\\n\\nIs that all a dream, my friend\\nThe time we spent together\\nOn the slopes of the mountain\\nBesides the waterfalls\\nBeneath the shadow of fruit-laden trees\\nWhen he held my hand\\nAnd we were both lost in happiness\\nIs that all a dream, my friend\\nOr just a thought in my mind\\nIn the grove of punnai trees\\nUnder the golden rays of the evening sun\\nHe called me near\\nAnd whispered words of love\\nIn my ears\\n\\n\\x0cIs that all a dream my friend\\nIs that miracle nothing but a lie?\\nDefying all security\\nLike a thief he walked in stealth\\nAnd with boundless love\\nHeld me in embrace\\nAnd smothered me with kisses\\nDid it happen?\\nWeren’t we happy?\\nIs that all a dream, my friend\\nOr just a thought in my mind\\n\\nSeveral stanzas followed, each set to a different tune. All the three were drowned\\nin that sublime music. Nandini had made her heart harder than a rock due to\\nvarious reasons that were peculiar to her life. Even she was shedding tears,\\nthanks to the power of music and the emotion in Manimekalai’s voice.\\n\\nThe Crown Prince forgot this world. Vandhiya Thevan looked at Manimekalai\\nevery now and then as if he just recovered from a shock. And every time he saw\\nher he found that she was looking at him with all the love in the world. Vandhiya\\nThevan was in for a greater shock. “Oh My God! I have wronged this angel. I\\nhave made her think that I am in love with her.” His mind was filled with\\nremorse.\\n\\nBeing submerged in the world of music and emotions they did not notice that the\\n\\n\\x0cwind was becoming stronger and stronger. They did not see the small wavelets in\\nthe lake had grown into large waves. They did not notice that the breeze had\\nbecome a wind and the wind had become a storm. Only when a huge tree was\\nuprooted by the force of wind did they wake up to reality. They saw all the signs\\nof a storm. They saw the noisy waves hitting the shore.\\n\\nNandini was the first to notice that.\\n\\n“Oh My God! Where is our boat?” She virtually screamed. The boat was not in\\nits usual resting place. When they looked far into the lake they could see the\\nsmall figure of the boat being tossed away in water. It was moving deeper and\\ndeeper into water.\\n\\n“Aiyoo! What can we do now? We are stranded.” Nandini screamed again.\\n\\n“If you ladies know horse riding please take our horses. We’ll manage.”\\n\\n“Are you planning to have us killed, being caught under the huge trees which\\nmight fall in this gale?”\\n\\nKarikalan was not affected.\\n\\n“There is no need to go now. Let us remain here till the storm subsides. What are\\nwe going to do at the Palace? See we have enough food. At least we have the\\nmaterials and utensils. Manimekalai is there to entertain us with her songs. I\\nhave never been this happy in the recent past.”\\n\\n\\x0cVandhiya Thevan was concerned.\\n\\n“That’s not proper, Your Highness. What will Sambuvaraiyar and\\nKandhanmaran think of us?”\\n\\n“I suspect this man should have let loose the boat in the pretext of looking out\\nfor the leopard r.”\\n\\n“Akka, why do you blame him? Even when he came here I saw the boat near the\\nshore. Let us not worry, Akka. My father, when he sees the storm, will send a\\nboat to rescue us.”\\n\\nSoon her words became true. A few minutes later two large boats, which from a\\ndistance looked like ships, came towards the island. Sambuvaraiyar was in one\\nof them. He was happy to see all the four safe and happy. They boarded the boat.\\n\\nThe lake resembled an ocean in turbulence. A greater storm was raging in the\\nminds of all the four who were rescued. Sambuvaraiyar was the only one who\\nremained calm.\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\x0c'"

              "'\\x0cPonniyin Selvan Part 4  The Crown  Author:  Kalki  Rendered In English By:  Varalotti Rengasamy   \\x0cChapter 1 - On The Banks of River Kedilam  Many rivers ran through the country of Thirumunaippadi and made it fertile. River Kedilam was one of them. Lord Shiva who won over the heart of one of the greatest Nayanmars, Thirunavukkarasar was in Thiruvadikai Veerattanam which was on the banks of River Kedilam. The Lord who won over another great Nayanmar Sundaramurthy resided in Thirunavalur which was very close to the river. Between these two holy places ran the highway that connected the Thondai Mandalam, the Chozha Kingdom and the Central Provinces. The place where the highway crossed River Kedilam would be buzzing with activity throughout the day all round the year. The passengers would stop there for rest. The bullocks would be unyoked from the carts. People would have their food in that place. When they ate they would playfully throw cooked rice in the air which would be eagerly picked up by the hungry crows. Children seeing this sight would applaud and make strange sounds with their mouths - aahoo...aahoo. It was the beginning of the Tamil month of Aippasi which corresponded to October-November of English calendar. There was more water in the river than usual. The travellers who had stopped there for lunch were excited. The excitement resulted in a loud conversation. The whole place was noisy. And then came a noise which subdued all other sounds. The travellers were startled by the sudden noise. Some of them climbed up the bank to check the source of the sound. At first they could see only a screen of dust. Then they saw the Royal paraphernalia. There were elephants, horses, palanquins and standard bearers. When the retinue came near them they could hear the sound of the person heralding the royal dignitary. “Hail the greatest of warriors who entered the battle-field at the age of twelve, the Kopparakeasari who beheaded Veerapandiyan, the lion feared by those in the Twin Provinces even in their dreams, the Head of the Northern Armed Forces, the first born of Emperor Sundara Chozhan who reigns over the three worlds, the one and only Adithya Karikala Chozhan!”  \\x0cWhen the booming voice of the herald echoed in all the directions all the people on the banks of River Kedilam ran up to meet the Crown Prince. They stood on either sides of the road leaving a clear way of passage for the royal retinue. Heralds, the trumpet blowers and the standard bearers reached the river first. Three horses came in the rear. The horses carried young warriors. Even when they were at a distance people started pointing at them to identify them. “The one who comes in the middle is Adithya Karikalan. You should know by the golden crown that adorns his head. See how the crown shines in the rays of the sun.”  “You are praising this crown! You should see him wearing the grand crown of Karikal Valavan. They say that it will shine like a million suns.”  “Thambi that’s not the crown of Karikal Valavan. It is so described more to honour a tradition. The truth is that our emperor Sundara Chozhan is wearing the crown which was made during the times of Emperor Paranthaka. Nobody knows how long he will wear that crown.”  “Looks like everyone is worried about the life of Sundara Chozhan for quite some time. I have an intuition that he will live long.”  “May your words come true. Let him live long. So long as he lives there won’t be any chaos in the Kingdom.”  \\x0c“Well, I don’t buy that stuff, brother. Since the news of Ponniyin Selvan’s death the whole Chozha country is in a state of turmoil. A war may break out at any time. So say the people coming from the Chozha country.”  “Who’s going to fight with whom? What for?”  “They say that a war might break out between the Pazhuvettaraiyars and the Kodumbalur Chieftain. The Chieftains are assembling at the Kadambur Sambuvarayar Palace to prevent that war. Our Crown Prince too is going there.”  “The horses have come near. Don’t be so loud. It’ll land us in trouble.” - warned another guy. He also added:  “See the grief in the face of the Crown Prince.”  “How can it be otherwise? His brother is dearer to him than his own life. And if there’s no news about such a dear brother how can he be happy? See his plight. His father is in death bed. His brother’s fate is not known.”  “That’s not the reason for his grief. He wants to invade the Twin Provinces. He is frustrated because that could not happen.”  “Why? Who prevented him from waging a war against those Provinces?”  \\x0c“Who else but the Pazhuvettaraiyars? They refuse to give him the weapons and supplies necessary for a war of such magnitude.”  “Everyone has his own reason. No one knows the real reason behind the Prince’s grief.”  “Oh, here comes the great Mr. Know-all. We give up. You tell us the real reason.”  “Adithya Karikalan fell in love with a girl from the Pandya Kingdom. When the Prince went for the North Pennai War the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar forcibly married that girl. And that girl is now the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur. And she has unleashed a reign of terror in Chozha Kingdom. The Crown Prince has lost his mind after all these developments.”  “May be. May be. Who knows? You know our elders have said that all the wars in the world are caused by a woman.”  “Which elders told you that? That’s nonsense. If a Prince had fallen in love with a girl do you think that the girl would marry a sixty year old man? People may say a thousand things. Shouldn’t we use our brains?”  “Ok, agreed. Now you tell me why Adithya Karikalan is not yet married?”  “Shut up. They have come near. The one who comes to the right of the Prince is Parthibendra Pallavan. Who’s in the left? Isn’t that Vallavaraiyan Vandhiya  \\x0cThevan of the Vaana clan?”  “No. That’s Kandhanmaran, son of Kadambur Sambuvarayar. Sambuvarayar knew very well that if he sent a message the Crown Prince may not come. So he sent his own son as the messenger.”  “Which means the matter is very, very important.”  “The matter could be political. Or concerning the marriage of the Crown Prince. The Chieftains would be casting their net for the Prince - to marry off their daughters to him. The girl who marries him first would be the Queen of the Chozha Empire.”  The spectators at the banks of River Kedilam were talking so many things. The three horses stood near the bank. The chariot stood a little away under the shade of the pupil tree. The sole occupant of the chariot was the eighty-year old warrior Thirukkovilur Malayaman, the Emperor’s father-in-law and Karikalan’s grandfather. Adithya Karikalan turned back to look at his grandfather without getting off his horse. Chapter 2 - The Grandfather And The Grandson  The old man in the chariot signalled to Adithya Karikalan. The Crown Prince turned his horse and went towards the chariot. “Karikala, my child! It is time to take leave of you. I am going back to Thirukkovalur. I want to share something important with you before I go. Get down from the horse and come to that platform below the pupil tree over there.”  “As you please, Thaatha.”  The grandfather and the grandson dismounted and walked towards the platform. Parthibendran spoke to Kandhanmaran. “Thank God the old man decided to leave us. I was afraid that he might cling on to us till we reach our destination.”  “If only he did I had decided to push him into Vellaru and drown him.”  The young men laughed together. Malainadu Udaiyar, also known as Thirukkovalur Malaiyaman, started a long narration:  “Adithya, you were born twenty four years ago. You were born in my palace at Thirukkovalur. Oh My God! I can’t forget the celebration to mark your birth. It appears as if they happened only yesterday. People from your clan, my clan and all the Chieftains of the Chozha and Thondai Mandalam Kingdoms had come. Thirty thousand soldiers had come along with those Kings. I hosted a feast for all of them. I don’t have words to describe the grandeur of the feast. It was grander than even the coronation ceremony of your father. What my ancestors had accumulated in the treasury for a hundred years, I spent in the three-daycelebration to mark your birth. “Your great grandfather Emperor Paranthaka visited Thirukkovalur on the occasion. Your grandfather’s brother Kandaraathithar and your father Sundara Chozhan had come. When they learnt that a boy had been born, their joy knew no bounds. They were happy that you came into this world to continue the line of Chozha clan unbroken. Your grandfather’s elder brothers did not have sons till then. Your father was the only son to your grandfather Arinjaya Chozhan. Your father at your age was as handsome as the Love-God. Nobody had seen such a handsome man either in the Chozha clan or in any other clans of Tamilnadu. Of course your father had some troubles on account of his good looks. He was the most favoured child in the family. The women in the palace would dress him up as a woman. ‘If only he were a woman!’ they used to tell often. When he came of age all the kings from Srilanka to Vindyas were ready to offer their daughters to him. Not only was your father as handsome as Arjuna and the Love-God, he was the heir apparent of the Chozha throne. So there was a fierce competition amongst the Kings to have your father as their son-in-law. I was the lucky one to have that unique honour. “We, Malaiyamans, whether men or women, are not known for our looks. We  \\x0cwere a race who always thought that a man’s beauty is directly proportional to the number of war-wounds on his body. For our women, beauty only meant character and morality. When it was decided that your father should marry my daughter, my Kingdom erupted into such a grand celebration that the Chieftains of Tamilnadu were burning in jealousy over our good fortune. I could not care less. Your parents got married in Thanjavur. The whole world was amazed by the way the wedding was celebrated. The only event that was celebrated in a grander manner than your parents’ wedding was your birth. The happy discussion and debate we had to decide on your name still lingers in my memory. Some said that you should be named after your illustrious ancestor Karikal Valavan. I and a few others insisted that you should be named after your grandfather’s brother, Rajadithya. Finally we arrived at a compromise by having the best of both the worlds - you were named Adithya Karikalan. “Look over there, Adithya! You can see Thirunavalur’s temple tower. That was the place where Nambi Aarooran was born. Twenty five years ago your grandfather’s brother Rajadithya Chozhan camped there. I have heard many stories of warriors. I have seen many of them in Tamilnadu, a country known for its valour. But I have not seen anybody as valiant as Rajadithya Chozhan. Whosoever watched him fighting on that day would agree with me. He camped here to gather a large army and invade the provinces in the North. He had vowed to defeat the King of the Twin Provinces, Kannara Devan and raze his capital Maniyakedam to ground. You know, once in the past the Pallava Emperor destroyed the capital of Vathaapi. Rajadithyar wanted to do the same to Maniyakedam to teach a lesson to the Twin Provinces. And if he did that he too will become popular like Mamallan, the great Pallava King who conquered the Pulikesis. Do you think it’s an easy task to gather army for such an ambitious war? It is said that the Pallava King Mamallan spent seven years to gather an army to invade Vaathapi. Rajadithya said that he did not need such a long time and that he would have the army ready in three or four years. He chose the area between River Kedilam and River Thenpannai as the best place to recruit the army and train them in warfare. Adithya, you are not fortunate enough to witness the scene that unfolded in a place between the two rivers. And those who saw it could not forget it for the rest of their lives. Rajadithya stayed in Thirunavalur along with thirty thousand soldiers. A chieftain from the Chera Kingdom by name Vellan Kumaran was camping on the banks of Pennai River along with twenty thousand soldiers. Your grandfather Arinjaya Chozhan was with me in Thirukkovalur. Arinjayan and I recruited and trained fifty thousand soldiers for the war. Along with us were the Senior Velar of Kodumbalur, the Pazhuvettaraiyar - who has now become the curse of Chozha Kingdom, Kadambur Sambuvaraiyar - the chieftain of this place, Thirumunaippadi, Munaiyatharaiyan, Mazhavaraiyar of Mazhanadu, the Kundrathur Kizhar and Vaithumbarayan, along with their vast armies. Huge battalions of cavalry, armies of elephants and the three great infantry regiments of Kaikolas also camped along with us. We had a lot of mock battles amongst ourselves for training. When elephants crashed against elephants the sound and the shock would resemble that of an earth quake. When the soldiers wielding shining spears rode on the horses the resultant sound would resemble the roar of the oceans during an apocalypse. When the soldiers shot a barrage of arrows in the air the skies would be covered by a screen of arrows. When the infantry marched ahead shouting battle cries it would appear that the end of the world was near. Scores of civilians would come there to witness the feats. The people of this Thirumunaippadi country and the Middle Provinces are very good. They are known for their valour. While the army was stationed here, their agricultural activities were affected. But they did not mind. As a measure of expressing his gratitude to these people Rajadithya ordered his people to dig a lot of lakes in these countries. He brought the Coleroon River up to Veera Narayanapuram and filled the lake with the water from the river. The one person who derived the maximum benefit from that project was Kadambur Sambuvaraiyar. In those days he used to be very humble and subservient before Rajadithya. When I see his pride and vanity today I am greatly surprised.”  \\x0cAdithya Karikalan intervened. “Thatha, why should you worry about Sambuvaraiyar’s pride? You tell me about the war at Thakkolam. How did the vast army gathered at the banks of river Kedilam leave this place? Why did our army face defeat in spite of the vast arrangements and meticulous planning? Rajadithya was one of the greatest warriors of our times. And he was heading such a mighty army. How did the enemy manage to defeat them at Thakkolam? I know, Thatha, you also took part in the war. You must have seen what happened at the great battle field.”  “Yes, my child. I was there. I was about to describe the scene.”  “Rajadithya gathered a vast army here. He also went to distant places to train the soldiers. Due to some reason which I do not remember now he could not leave the place as planned. Meanwhile we got the news that there was a war in Srilanka. A part of the army had to go there. When there was a strong enemy in the South the Chozha Emperor did not want the Chozha Generals and the soldiers go farther in the North. The Emperor suggested that the army could leave after the Lankan war was over. Rajadithya did not want to go against the words of his father, the then Chozha Emperor. He waited patiently for the Lankan war to end. But the enemies were not patient. The King of the Twin Provinces, Kannara Thevan, came with a huge army to invade the Chozha Kingdom. As he travelled south to invade us, Boothukan, the Kanga King joined forces with him. Those were two huge armies. At a glance it looked as if the North and the South seas merged into one great ocean eager to swallow the Chozha Kingdom. In that vast ocean of their army there were many, many giant whales, I mean the elephants, and many sharks, I mean the horses. At one time it appeared that the vast ocean would drown the entire Chozha Kingdom, as the seas would swallow the earth at the time of apocalypse. Our spies ran all the way up here to break the devastating news of invasion. “Even that happened for good, said Emperor Paranthaka. If our armies had  \\x0ctravelled up north to fight the enemy they would have been fatigued by the long journey and would have lost the enthusiasm to fight. That way it was better to face the enemy in the home ground. It was easy to corner them on all the four sides and vanquish them in our homeland. The Emperor allowed us to travel only when we got the news that the enemy’s army had reached Thirupathi. “Rajadithya was raring to go. And the moment he got the Emperor’s permission he headed a huge army up North. The army consisted of three hundred thousand infantrymen, fifty thousand horsemen, ten thousand elephants, two thousand chariots, three hundred and twenty generals and thirty two Chieftains. I was fortunate to be one of them; and was unfortunate to come back alive. After three days of travel the armies clashed against each other at a place called Thakkolam which was two miles north from Kanchi. “Adithya, we have heard about the war between Devendra and Vrithirasura in our mythology. We also know about the Rama - Ravana war and the Pandava Kaurava war. But those who saw the Thakkolam war would say that the mythological wars were nothing but small skirmishes. We were outnumbered in the ratio of one to two. I came to know later that the army of the enemy had five hundred thousand infantry men and thirty thousand trained elephants. So what? There was no one on the enemy side who was half as valiant as your ancestor Rajadithya. So the Goddess of Valour and the Goddess of Victory were clearly on our side. “The war lasted for ten days. It was difficult even to take a count of the soldiers who lost their lives in the war. Dead elephants resembling black hillocks were scattered all over the battle field. Both the sides had lost heavily. But the enemy’s side became weak quite soon. The enemies soon found out the reason. Wherever Rajadithya’s elephant went proudly displaying the Tiger flag, the Goddess of Victory was following suit. Whenever a section of our army felt disheartened Rajadithya would go there along with his elephant. As soon as the  \\x0csoldiers saw the huge beast and the greatest warrior of our times sitting on it, they became excited and attacked the enemy with three times\\' greater ferocity than what they did before. The enemies who were closely following the events of the war hatched a mean conspiracy. We came to know of it only much later. The person who hatched the conspiracy and the one who executed it was none other than the Kanga King, Boothukan. Suddenly the treacherous king hoisted the white flag of peace on his elephant, lifted both his hands above his head and approached our army repeating the words, “surrender” again and again. Rajadithya was near him. I think he must have done that only after seeing Rajadithya’s elephant. Rajadithya’s heart melted when he saw the enemy king surrendering to him. He wanted to know whether the King of the Twin Provinces himself wants to stop the war or was the Kanga King parting ways to save him. He blew his conch. He ordered his body guards to stand away. He asked the enemy king Boothukan to approach his elephant. Boothukan kept his hands folded till he approached Rajadithya. Rajadithya even saw tears in his eyes. His heart melted more. The greatest warrior of his times, the one and only Rajadithya forgot the sane advice given by the great Tamil sage Thiruvalluvar - “Hidden inside the hands of an enemy folded in supplication will be a weapon to kill; even an enemy’s tears are of the same kind.”  Rajadithya was moved by the enemy’s tears. So he let Boothukan come very close to him and asked him, “What is the news?” Boothukan’s response made Rajadithya hate him. The treacherous king told him that he knew for sure that the armies of the Twin  \\x0cProvinces would be crushed in the encounter. Hence he advised Kannara Devan to surrender to the Chozha forces. Since Kannara Devan refused he came alone to surrender. Rajadithya was furious. He told him that he would never have such a traitor on his side. He advised him to go back to his side and fight on the side of his ally, Kannara Devan. As Rajadithya was talking Boothukan committed the meanest treachery ever recorded in the history of Kings. He took out this bow and shot a poisoned arrow into the chest of Rajadithya. The great Chozha warrior fell down. Nobody was prepared for that mean act of betrayal from Boothukan. The Chozha warriors and Rajadithya’s bodyguards could not understand what happened. Everything happened in a flash. They heard Rajadithya telling the enemy king to go back to his side. The next moment they saw Boothukan driving his elephant hard to run away from the scene. Rajadithya died while remaining seated on the elephant. It was the most devastating news for our army. It was as if a giant lightning had struck every soldier in the army. The grief of our army was so much that for a moment they simply forgot to fight. Chieftains, generals and soldiers stopped fighting and started wailing. No wonder the enemy gained an upper hand. Very soon our army was forced to retreat from the war. And it was quite easy to drive away an army which was fleeing the battle field. I am ashamed to say that I was one of those who fled the battle at that time. The enemy’s army had reached up to the banks of River Kedilam. We regained our consciousness only when we reached here. I took my family from Thirukkovalur and left them at my fort in Malainadu. I started gathering an army on the slopes of the mountains. I came back here every now and then to drive away the enemy forces that had set up their base here. Even then the enemy did not leave this place for a long time. They stayed here and were quite a nuisance to our Kingdom. Kanchi was under their control. Three years ago you killed Veerapandiyan and came here to reclaim the city of Kanchi.”  \\x0c“Thatha, I know the entire history. Even then I love to hear about Rajadithya’s story again and again. It never ceases to amaze me. But tell me this, Thatha. Why did you remind me now of Rajadithya?”  “My Child, your grandfather’s brother, Rajadithya wanted to extend the Chozha Empire up to the banks of River Ganges. He died without realizing his dream. Now the whole Kingdom says that my grandson is no less than his illustrious ancestor Rajadithya. People are saying that you are going to fulfil Rajadithya’s dreams. I don’t want you to fall to treachery as he did. That’s why I reminded you of his story. “Thatha! My grandfather’s brother lost his life because of a mean conspiracy. Why do you remind me of that story? After all I am not going to war. I am not going to the enemy’s place to be betrayed. I am just going to see my father’s friends. I don’t think they’ll cheat me, Thatha.”  “Listen to me, my child. Our sage Thiruvalluvar said that there might be an arm hidden inside the hands folded in supplication or in the tears of an enemy. The same sage says elsewhere that the internal enmity is more dangerous than the external one. ‘You need not fear the enemy who like a sword is coming to attack you; but beware of the enemy in the guise of a friend.’  “My Child, you are now going in the midst of your enemies who are hiding under the cloak of friendship. I have tried my best to stop you. But you won’t listen. They have called you to mediate on a dispute concerning the Chozha Kingdom. I also learn that they are planning to get one of Sambuvaraiyar’s daughters married to you. But I still do not know what their real intentions are. You also do not know. There are many kings in this great country dying to give  \\x0ctheir daughters to you in marriage. You do not need this Sambuvaraiyar’s daughter for your career. I also learn that they are going to divide the Chozha Empire into two and give one half to you, while the other half goes to your uncle Madhuranthakan. I don’t know what kind of scam will be there in that Partition Plan. Whatever it may be I am going back to Thirukkovalur and will come back with my guards to wait for you at the banks of River Vellaru. When you are staying at Sambuvaraiyar’s palace if you suspect anybody or anything, send word to me.”  The old King knew that that Adithya Karikalan had not been listening to him. His attention was elsewhere. “Thatha! Look there.” Adithya Karikalan spoke with trepidation. The valiant old man looked in the direction pointed out by him. Chapter 3 - The Falcon And The Dove  Adithya Karikalan pointed to a Mandapam. The Mandapam was made of stone. Some philanthropist might have built it for the convenience of the travellers. It provided shelter from the sun and rain. The structure was old and the outer walls clearly exhibited the signs of ageing. There were some sculpted images near the entrance of the Mandapam. The old man, Malaiyaman, could not see them with his failing eye sight. “Do you see that, Thatha?”  “You mean the Mandapam, my child? I don’t see anything special about it. The Mandapam looks empty to me. Nobody is in there.”  “I now know for sure that you’ve become old, Thatha. Your eyes are failing. See there. Don’t you see a falcon? Oh My God! How huge it is! See how broad its wings are. But what a cruelty, Thatha! It’s holding a small dove in its legs. The sharp nails of the falcon are piercing the dove. The dove is bleeding. Can’t you see the blood, Thatha? What a surprise! There is another dove nearby. The second dove is hovering near the falcon. Perhaps this is the beloved of the captured bird. She’s flying very close to the dangerous falcon. She’s pleading for her lover’s life. She’s begging the falcon to spare her lover. But wait, is the dove fighting with the falcon or pleading with him? Oh My God! How bold she is! She is now trying to fight with the falcon. She is going to fight with the giantbird for her beloved’s life. But Thatha do you think that the falcon will have mercy on the dove? No, it won’t. Never. It must have eaten many doves like this one. See the falcon’s huge body. It has eaten many doves in the past and that explains his fat body. Oh Evil Falcon! Here I am coming to kill you.”  \\x0cAdithya Karikalan took a pebble and threw at the falcon. The pebble hit the Mandapam and fell down. “Devil! Giant! You deserve this and much more”  Adithya Karikalan laughed in a devilish manner. His grandfather Malaiyaman already had doubts about his grandson’s sanity. The suspicion got stronger now. “Thatha, why are you looking at me like that? For heaven’s sake please go near the Mandapam and have a look.”  Malaiyaman went near the Mandapam and looked at the place where Karikalan’s stone had fallen. He saw a sculpture there. A falcon was holding a dove in its legs. Another dove was fighting with the falcon. The sculpture looked very real. Malaiyaman returned to his grandson. “Yes, my child. I’ve become old. My eyesight is failing. I could not see the sculpture till I went near it. Good work of art.”  “That’s too mild a word, Thatha. It’s wonderful. It’s a miracle on stone. Must have been done by some artist from the Mahendra Varman - Mamallan period. At first I thought it was not a sculpture but a real scene.”  \\x0c“Adithya, the miracle is not just in the stone. It’s in your eyes as well. It’s in your mind too. Hundreds of travellers pass through this way. Many of them would not have even cared to look at the sculpture. The rest would have just given a cursory glance. Only somebody gifted like you can appreciate the art in the stone.”  “I am not appreciating, Thatha. I am not surprised. I am furious. I want to destroy the sculpture right now. I don’t want to praise the man who created such a cruel sculpture.”  “What is this I am hearing, Karikala? When did your heart, which used to be as strong as a diamond, become so soft? The falcon devouring the dove is its given nature. If a lion were to show compassion to sheep it won’t be a lion. It too would become a sheep. Those who want to sit on the throne have to destroy their enemies and traitors. Those who want to become great Emperors and bring the whole world under their sway have to kill their enemies. If the falcon did not kill the dove how can it be a falcon? Why are you upset by its act, Karikala?”  “Thatha, you speak the truth. But should not the falcon be compassionate after seeing the lady dove pleading so passionately for her beloved? Should it not release the dove at least for the sake of its lover? Ok, tell me this, Thatha. When you are about to kill your enemy, if his lover were to fall at your feet and beg for your mercy what will you do? Will you not show mercy on your enemy?”  “Never Karikala, Never! If a woman comes in between I’ll just push her away with my left foot and kill my enemy. I’d have no qualms about that act. Didn’t our saint Thiruvalluvar say that the enemies would carry weapons in the hands folded in supplication or in their tears? In a way a woman’s tears are more dangerous than a man’s, because a woman’s tears have the powers to melt our heart. And a person who lets his heart melt can’t do anything great in his life. He’ll be far worse than a woman.”  “Thatha, why are you degrading women? That would be an insult to my mother, who is a woman and who also happens to be your daughter.”  “Listen, my child. The love I have for my daughter … there is not even a pale comparison to that in this whole world. I had six sons, my child. They were all great warriors. They were like the legendary Bheema and Arjuna. But alas, I lost them all in the battle-field. I was never sad when I heard about the death of my dear sons. But when your mother got married and went away from me to adorn the Chozha throne ... Oh my God ... I was devastated. But I did not show my feelings. Not even to my daughter, my child. Do you know what I told your mother before her marriage? I said:  ’Daughter dearest, you are going to marry an emperor. Don’t be proud on that account. Marrying such a famous king will only add to your woes. Many of your maids will be far happier than you. Prepare yourself for a life of grief and misery. If you don’t bear children to your husband he will marry other women. You should never grieve for that, my dear. If sons are born to you, bring them up as warriors. And if you hear that your sons died in the battlefield you should not shed tears for them. If your husband is happy, be happy. If your husband is sad then go out of the way to make him happy. If your husband is sick, you should attend on him. And if he dies then you die with him. Even if your heart bleeds you should never shed tears. This is how the women from the Malaiyaman clan live.’  \\x0c“That was the advice I gave to my daughter, to your mother when she got married. I am proud to say that my daughter has never gone against my advice so far. Karikala, she has brought you and your brother up as matchless warriors. Ever since your father fell ill, she has been by his side night and day attending to him. I am really proud to have that gem as my daughter, Karikala.”  “Thatha, whenever I think of my mother, my heart bursts in pride. But let me ask you one thing. Let’s say my father is being held by his worst enemy. Let’s say he’s going to kill him. He’s coming near him with a drawn sword. What will my mother do then? Will she beg the enemy to spare her husband’s life? Especially when the enemy is someone known to her?”  “My child! Your mother will never beg for her husband’s life. And that too from an enemy. Malaiyaman’s daughter will never insult the clan she was born in or the clan she was married into. She’ll consider her husband’s enemy as her enemy. And if her husband dies she’ll fall on him and die too. Or else she’ll harden her heart and decide to live. And if she did so, it will be for the sole purpose of revenging her husband’s death.”  Adithya Karikalan let out a long sigh. “Can I go now, Thatha?”  “Is it absolutely necessary that should you go?”  “Do you still have doubts, Thatha? We have come more than half way.”  \\x0c“Yes, we have. I first asked you not to go. Then I changed my mind. After hearing about your brother I thought its better that you go. But I don’t think Arulmozhivarman would have died.”  “Nor do I.”  “When your father was young, we did not know where he was for some time. It was only much later that our soldiers found him in an island in Srilanka. Similarly Arulmozhi must be in some island. He is sure to come back after some time. But then the news of his death has made the Chozha country erupt into a fury. Your parents must also be in a state of grief. This is the time you should be with them and offer solace. When you go there it’s better to go as a friend of Pazhuvettaraiyars rather than as their enemy. That’s the only reason I let you accept Sambuvaraiyar’s invitation. He has deliberately avoided me. If I had been invited I would have surely come along with you.”  “Do you fear for my safety? Do you think I am an imbecile?”  “No, Karikala! Never! I know your valour. I won’t think twice to send you in the midst of an enemy army consisting of ten thousand men armed to their teeth. But I tremble in fear to send you before a cunning woman who is shedding tears to distract your attention.”  “I don’t think Sambuvaraiyar’s daughter is that cunning. I hear that she is a timid girl who is afraid to come in the presence of men. Kandhanmaran has told me. Let me make one thing very clear, Thatha. I am not that rash to marry a girl without getting my parents’ blessings. I also know that there are two women in your own clan waiting to be married off.”  \\x0c“I never thought of that, Karikala. My eldest son has two daughters. But I have no idea of burdening you with them. Already the Chieftains of Chozha Kingdom are burning in jealousy because my daughter is married to the reigning Emperor. And that jealousy has grown into enmity. And if this too happens then they will join forces to invade my country. I’ll be happy if you marry Sambuvaraiyar’s daughter. You see, I have become old. My body has become weak. At times I feel that weakness in my mind too. I even wonder whether this will be the last time I see you. Perhaps it is. I don’t think I can help you any longer. You need some new friends for sure. You need people who are interested in your welfare. Hence I’d be very happy if you marry Sambuvaraiyar’s daughter.”  “Thatha, I can’t do that even for your happiness. I am going to Sambuvaraiyar’s palace as a guest not to seek his friendship. Or to marry his daughter. You can be peaceful.”  “Then why should you go my child? Why don’t you tell me the truth? I overheard your friends’ conversation. I heard that the devil whom the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar has married has sent you a message. And you are going to Kadambur only for that reason.”  “You are right, Thatha.”  “Oh My God! What times are we in? The Chozha clan in which you are born has a two-thousand year old tradition. Some of your ancestors had brought the whole world under their rule. At times they were mere chieftains who ruled over the city of Uraiyur and its surroundings. Some were like Lord Ram, faithfully wedded to a single woman all their lives. Some married many women and gave birth to many warriors. Some worshipped Lord Shiva and some Lord Vishnu. Some were staunch atheists. But every one of them had a blemish-less character. They never indulged in anything scandalous. They have never fallen for others’ wives. My child, you can marry as many virgins as you want. Your grandfather’s father - Emperor Paranthaka - married seven women. You can be like him. Nobody can raise their finger against you. But never look at that devilish woman who is married to the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar.”  “Forgive me, Thatha. I’ll never do anything of that sort. I’ll never bring ignominy to the Chozha clan or the Malaiyaman clan. “Then why did you accept her invitation, my child?”  “Let me tell the truth at least to you. Once I did her a grievous wrong. I am going to seek her pardon.”  “What words, Karikala? How can you beg the pardon of a woman? I can’t bear to hear those words.”  For a while Karikalan hung down his head remaining silent. Then he gathered courage and told his grandfather everything. He spoke about how he searched for Veerapandiyan and how Nandini begged for his life and how he mercilessly killed him and how he had been suffering since that day. “That memory is torturing me, Thatha. I won’t be peaceful unless I see her once and seek her forgiveness. It appears that she is ready to forgive me. She is also interested in avoiding succession problems in the Chozha Empire. She has called me only for that purpose. I’ll finish my work and come back to Kanchi very soon. And once I come back I’ll take a ship to search for my brother in the seven seas of this world.”  \\x0cThe old man sighed. “Many things are becoming clear to me. Whatever appeared mysterious earlier is now very clear. One thing is very sure, my child. Nobody can win over Destiny.”  \\x0cChapter 4 - The Ayyanar Temple  When Adithya Karikalan was in conversation with his grandfather on the banks of River Kedilam Azhwarkkadian and Vandhiya Thevan were engaged in a strange mission at a place called Thirukkanaattumullur on the Northern Banks of River Coleroon. In those days Coleroon, otherwise known as North Cauvery, was considered as much a holy river as its counterpart, the Southern Cauvery. In the Tamil month of Aippasi (corresponding to October-November of the English Calendar) Lord Shiva, the principal deity of the temple was in Thirukkanaattumullur would come in a procession riding on the traditional bull to the river banks to give dharshan to his devotees. Every afternoon will be festival time during the whole of that month. People from the nearby villages would gather there for the occasion. The town had a small Vishnu temple as well. Lord Vishnu also would come in procession to the banks of Coleroon riding on his vehicle, Garuda, the bird. That was the first day of the month and people had gathered in large numbers to take a holy dip in the river. Azhwarkkadian planted a branch of a Jamun tree on the banks and challenged the visitors to a wordy duel. “CHALLENGE! CHALLENGE! I have come here to establish the supremacy of the religion of Vaishnavism in this island. Saivites, Buddhists, Advaitins, Kapalikas, Kalamukas, Jains and Sakthas... I invite you to a debate. If you win I’ll bear you on my shoulders and go all over the town. And if you lose you’ll have to give whatever you have. I’ll let you wear only a small piece of cloth on  \\x0cyour waist. You’ll have to give everything else to me. CHALLENGE! CHALLENGE”  Lying before him were heaps of rosary beads, the vessels used by the sages, earjewels, silk cloth and gold coins. Anybody could infer that he must have been arguing for a long time. And must have had a continuous streak of victories. Vandhiya Thevan stood close to him leaning on a Kadamba tree. He was dressed only up to his waist. And was holding an unsheathed sword in his hand. From his appearance and posture one could easily guess that he had been using his sword to frighten away those who tried to use violence to win the wordy duel with Azhwarkkadian. And that was made clear by the words he spoke to a group of noisy Saivites. “I warn you. You are welcome to have a debate with this man. But anybody who resorts to violence, anybody who tries to touch this man will become a prey to my sword.”  He swirled the sword twice to demonstrate his intentions. The Saivites who were an angry mob only a few seconds ago became silent and peaceful. One of them shouted at Azhwarkkadian:  “Oh Vaishnavite! Don’t be too proud of your victories. Go to Thirunaaraiyur. There you’ll meet Nambiyandaar Nambi who will defeat you in the debate and make you run for your life.”  \\x0c“Ask your Thirunaaraiyur Nambi to argue with Anandha Bhattar of Thirunarayanapuram...” Azhwarkkadian shot back. Azhwarkkadian shouted “CHALLENGE” “CHALLENGE” several times. This time there were no takers. He removed the branch of the Jamun tree and planted in its stead a victory flag which had the Vaishnavite symbols of the conch and the disc. Some Vaishnavites had been watching his actions. When they saw the victory flag they all ran to him, lifted him on their shoulders and hailed his victory. “Narayana is our Lord. Come let’s worship him.”  They started dancing around him singing the same refrain. There was a competition among them in inviting Azhwarkkadian for lunch at their homes. Azhwarkkadian accepted the invitation and told them in a majestic voice. “Yes, we’ll come to your place for food.”  He took Vandhiya Thevan with him. They had tamarind rice, curd rice and a sweet porridge. The dishes were so delicious that they had their stomachs filled up. Azhwarkkadian surveyed the spoils of his debating game. He retained a piece of silk cloth and gave all the rest to the Vaishnavites and requested them to pay whatever they considered to be the worth of those things. He told them that he was keen on establishing the supremacy of Vaishnavism and for that purpose travelling up North up to Haridwar. And therefore he needed gold coins for the travel. The Vaishnavites were pleased and gave him more gold than what those things were worth. Azhwarkkadian and Vandhiya Thevan took leave of their hosts and left for Kadambur. River Coleroon was in floods at that time. They used a boat to cross the river. They had to leave their horses behind. The boat was overcrowded. It capsized when it was about to reach the bank. Vandhiya Thevan had to swim along with the other passengers. In the process he lost his waist band which he had been preserving for years. The waist band had some signet rings and the message given by Princess Kunthavai. They were all washed away. He also lost the gold coins. In fact they had planned the strategy of a religious debate only earn money to buy horses for their travel. Of course their strategy had worked and they had money. But they could not buy horses anywhere in the vicinity. Horses might be available for sale in the weekly market in Kadambur. Or else they had to travel all the way up to Thiruppathiripulliyur for buying horses. The friends debated whether they should now go to Kadambur or not. They listed out the pros and cons of travelling up to Kadambur. They might get some news about Adithya Karikalan’s travel plans. They might know whether the Crown Prince had left Kanchi and the route taken by him. But they should not be seen by anybody known to them in Kadambur. It would be a disaster if they met Kandhanmaran at Kadambur. And if Pazhuvettaraiyar’s retinue had reached Kadambur already then their staying in that place would be highly risky. Vandhiya Thevan opened the conversation. “Vaishnava, you know how to scale a wall. Why don’t you bring two horses from Sambuvaraiyar’s stable?”  “Yes, I can scale a wall. But, my friend, I don’t think Sambuvaraiyar’s horses can. And that’s the problem.”  \\x0c“If Pazhuvur’s retinue is there we can steal two horses from them. Once they drove away my horse. I want to take revenge.”  Then they started talking about their earlier meeting at Kadambur and the mysterious happenings of that eventful night. They reached Kadambur at sunset. Kadambur, as they expected, was abuzz with activity. The Palace and the main entrance to the Fort were decorated with festoons. Security was tight around the main gate and along the walls of the Fort. After all, the Crown Prince of the Chozha Kingdom was paying a visit. Added to that, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Pazhuvettaraiyar along with his wife the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur was also paying a visit. These dignitaries would come with a large retinue. The town would be in a festive mood for some days. The two friends heard the people talking about all these things in the streets of Kadambur. From what they heard they could infer that none of the dignitaries had yet arrived. They also learned that Kandhanmaran, son of Sambuvaraiyar, had gone all the way to Kanchi to escort Adithya Karikalan safely to Kadambur. In the midst of the excitement surrounding the visit of the Crown Prince the two friends also heard some people talking about the ‘drowned prince’ in a hushed voice. When such a great tragedy had struck the nation it was not somehow right to have this feasts and festivals. Azhwarkkadian and Vandhiya Thevan heard what the people talked. But they did not evince any interest in the conversation. They crossed the town. They did not want to stay in the town for the night. They were scouting for a Mandapam in ruins or an abandoned inn somewhere in the outskirts of the city. In the extreme case of their not finding any such place they planned to go to Veeranarayanapuram and stay there for the night. They could peacefully sleep in  \\x0cthe 100-pillared-Mandapam of the Vishnu Temple. After what they experienced the previous night they were badly in need of a good night’s sleep. As they crossed the city limits they saw a dense bamboo forest and an Ayyanar Temple inside the forest. “Vaishnava, I can’t walk even a step more. Let’s stay in the temple for the night. This is the best place to keep away from the eyes of people.”  “You are wrong, young man. What’s the guarantee that persons like us would not choose this place for the night stay?”  “If such people come with horses it will be all the more better.”  “No horse can enter this bamboo forest. Even men will find it difficult to come in.”  “There has to be a way somewhere. It could be just a single track. There has to be a way for the temple priest to reach the temple.”  The two men were walking in circle around the bamboo bushes. At last they found out a narrow single-track path in the middle of dense growth. It was no mean achievement to walk through the path without being hurt by the thorns in the bush. After walking for a few minutes they arrived at a clearing. There was a small Ayyanar temple. There was a small altar in front of the temple. Images of elephants and horses made of mud were found near the altar. It was the custom  \\x0cof the devotees to gift such images to god if their prayers were answered. Vandhiya Thevan was in a mood to tease. “Why should we worry about horses? Why can’t we borrow two from Ayyanar himself?”  “Haven’t you heard the Tamil proverb that one should not get into a river relying on a mud horse?”  “Vaishnava, our Ayyanar is a powerful god. He would grant our prayers immediately. He is not like your Vishnu who would make his devotees, suffer, wait and yearn while he sleeps in day time.”  “Then do you mean to say that your God will breathe life into these mud horses? Well, that will be a real blessing. It will save us a lot of money.”  “If your devotion is real even mud horses will come to life. Tell me what is our body? It’s made of sand and Lord Brahma breathed life into it.”  “Well said. We quite often forget that this body is made of mud. It is only to remind that basic fact that we make a paste of the holy sand and apply it on our bodies as religious symbols. That’s what our Vaishnavite Acharyas have ordered us to do.”  \\x0cVandhiya Thevan whispered “ssh ... “and held Azhwarkkadian’s hand and pointed out at a distance. The sun had set a little earlier. Darkness was slowly setting in the bamboo forest. In the fading light it appeared as if Ayyanar’s mud horses had come to life and were moving. An elephant and a horse shifted places. Vandhiya Thevan did not know whether to believe the miracle happening right before his eyes. At the same time he did not want to miss the chance of showing Ayyanar’s divine powers to Azhwarkkadian. “Vaishnava, can you see what’s happening?”  Before he finished the sentence Azhwarkkadian gripped his hand hard and placed a finger on his lips asking him to maintain absolute silence. Then without taking off his hand he led Vandhiya Thevan to a safe hiding place behind the bushes. The elephant and the horse moved a little creating a space between them. A man’s head appeared in the space. The head turned in all the four directions. It was a ghastly sight to see a human head very near the altar turning in all the directions. Vandhiya Thevan who had seen many ghastly sights in his life shivered in fear. But the firm Azhwarkkadian’s hands gave him reassurance. Vandhya Thevan felt protected. As they were watching, the head moved up a little more. Now they could see up to the man’s chest. Then they saw the whole man. The place from which he emerged did not look like a hole in the ground. It appeared as the dark passage to the nether world. The friends recognised the man in a few seconds. He was a part of Ravidasan’s conspiracy gang while apparently working for the Kadambur Palace. He was Idumbankari. The two friends recognised him at the same time and looked at each other exchanging meaningful glances. Idumbankari did not make any attempt to cover the hole through which he came. He looked around a few more times and then started walking towards the Ayyanar Temple. He opened the door of the temple and walked in. A few minutes later they could see a dim flickering light in the temple. They inferred that a lamp inside the temple had been lit. “Thambi what do you think of this?” Azhwarkkadian asked in a whisper. “I think Ayyanar is a powerful god. Didn’t you see the horse coming to life?”  “That’s okay. What do you think of the man we just saw?”  “Should be the temple priest. Come, let’s go in and pray.”  “Wait. Let’s see if somebody else comes to pray.”  “Do you think anybody else will come?”  “Then why should he light the lamp?”  “What’s the big deal in a priest lighting a lamp at the temple?”  \\x0c“Thambi, can’t you recognise him?”  “Why not? He’s the one who got me a horse at the banks of Southern banks of Coleroon. Yes, he is Idumbankari. I think I can ask him to get me a horse now.”  “Good Idea.”  “Why, you don’t like it?”  “Idumbankari is a part of Ravidasan’s gang.”  “Then I have a better idea.”  “What? What?”  “While Idumbankari is busy serving God let me find out from where he appeared all of a sudden.”  “How is that possible?”  “Can’t I look into the hole from which he came out?”  \\x0c“Possible. But the risks... “  “There is nothing worthwhile which is not risky.”  “It’s your call.”  “Vaishnavite, you be here and find out what’s happening.”  “That’s not a problem. Do you have any idea where this tunnel goes?”  “Yes, I do. I want to test my hypothesis.”  “But why?”  “It might be useful sometime. Who knows?”  They heard some voices at a distance. “We can’t wait any longer. I am sure you’ll be here till I come back. Or will you ditch me in the same way Sugriva ditched his brother Vali when the latter went into a cave to fight with a demon?”  \\x0c“I’ll be here as long as I am alive. But what’s the guarantee you’ll return?”  “I’ll return if I am alive.”  Vandhiya Thevan reached the hole in a few giant steps. And jumped in. The next second he vanished. For a second it appeared as if the gaping hole swallowed him alive. Idumbankari came out of the temple. He saw the open hole. He went near the altar and rotated the trident which appeared to be embedded on the temple floor. The mud elephant and the horse which had moved away earlier came closer again. The hole disappeared. Idumbankari then moved to the entrance of the temple. At the same time Ravidasan, Soman Sambavan and others arrived there from different directions. Azhwarkkadian hid himself behind the bamboo bushes. Ravidasan sat on the steps. Others sat on the floor before him. “Friends, time has come to fulfil our vows.”  “You have been saying these words for the past six months.”  “There is nothing wrong in it. For the past six months the D-day remained very close. Now it’s even closer. It’s a matter of a few days. We have got news that Adithya Karikalan has left Kanchi already. The old man from Thirukkovalur, King Malaiyaman, tried his best to stop him. I hear all his efforts failed.”  \\x0c“What’s the guarantee he will not be stopped on the way?”  “Adithya Karikalan will never change his mind. He won’t listen to anybody.”  “What if the message sent by his sister reached him?”  “How can it? We have kept him bound in the forest.”  “Beautiful. I saw him in the northern banks of Coleroon this morning. I saw another enemy with him.”  “Who was that?”  “The fake Vaishnavite.”  “Then we will have to be very careful. We should make sure that they do not meet Adithya Karikalan.”  “That’s doing things in a roundabout way. We could have killed the messenger and sealed his fate. Why did the Queen ask us to keep him alive?”  \\x0c“Friends, I too did not understand her logic first. But later I realised that the Queen is a better strategist than I. She asked us to let him live for a very important reason. There is no need for you to know that at this point of time. Let’s not bother about Vandhiya Thevan. But if you see that Vaishnavite anywhere, kill him on the spot. Don’t even think.”  \\x0cChapter 5 - The Deadly Underground Tunnel  Vandhiya Thevan entered the deadly Tunnel and walked down a few steps. Then it was level ground. There was little light. He walked another ten to fifteen steps. Then he heard the sound of some wheels moving. The next moment he was engulfed in absolute darkness. He painfully remembered his earlier resolution of not meddling in affairs that did not concern him. Oh My God! What is my mission? How crucial it is? Why did I neglect my work and enter this tunnel? Where will this lead me to? And what dangers are waiting for me there? Why do I always end up doing something foolish every time? When will I be able to shed off my impulsive rashness? He decided to abandon the venture and go back. He turned around. He could feel the steps. But he could not find the opening above him. He tried to feel with his hand. It was of no use. Somebody must have closed the hole from above. Vandhiya Thevan was shocked. He was sweating profusely. He now tried harder to open the closed hole. He could hear voices at a distance. Perhaps the voices came from the people who had come to the Ayyanar temple. Idumban Kari was waiting for somebody. His lighting the lamp at the temple must have been a signal for somebody to come there. If that was true then Vandhiya Thevan finding a way out of the tunnel at that time might be a great blunder. How long would they be at the temple? He could never know. If they were all Idumban Kari’s men like Ravidasan then they would talk for a long, long time. But why were they assembled there? And what were they talking about? What kind of conspiracy were they hatching at the moment? The Vaishnavite fanatic must be watching them. There is no point in standing here in the tunnel bathed in sweat and gasping for breath. The only sensible way is to go further down the tunnel. Having got down  \\x0cthe tunnel let me at least find out where does it lead to. Having made a firm decision Vandhiya Thevan marched forward. There was level ground beneath his feet. But the surface was rough and bumpy. They must have hewn the tunnel through stone. He had a broad idea where the tunnel would lead him to - probably Sambuvaraiyar’s Palace. But where exactly in the Palace? It might take him to the treasury. Or to the ladies’ chambers. He knew that the palaces generally had these types of secret passages. When the Palace is under siege and the Kings needed these secret passage to escape from their enemies. Generally in times of danger the top priority would be to save the women of the palace. So these tunnels usually landed in the ladies chambers. To carry the treasures out of the Palace in times of crisis was at least as important as saving the ladies. So there was an equally good chance that the tunnel ended in Sambuvaraiyar’s treasury. Idumban Kari had used this tunnel to come out. That made the chances of landing at the treasury much brighter. These conspirators had been plundering the treasury of the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar with the help of the Junior Queen. In the same way they might have planned to rob King Sambuvaraiyar. But why should they indulge in such an act when the Crown Prince and other important people were visiting the Palace? Could they possibly have other motives as well? Vandhiya Thevan remembered what he saw and heard in Thiruppurambayam War Memorial. The image of the long sword with the emblem of fish held by the Junior Queen flashed before his eyes. Vandhiya Thevan shivered. Perhaps they had a motive far more dangerous than a simple robbery. If he knew where the path led him it would be easier for him to sabotage the plans of conspirators. He had been walking through the tunnel only for a few minutes. But it appeared a very long time because of the darkness. The ventilation was minimal. He was gasping for breath. He was sweating as well. When he mentally calculated the distance between the Ayyanar Temple and the Palace he felt overwhelmed. They had walked from the front gates of the palace in a roundabout way. They had to cross the streets and go through a forest. If they had come from the back gates of the Palace using a direct route the distance to the Ayyanar temple would have been far less. It should be within the range of an arrow-shot from the Palace. If that was true he must have reached the outer walls of the palace by now. Vandhiya Thevan’s guess was right. He could feel a sudden gush of cool air. The air refreshed him. He looked up. He could see light at a distance. He could even hear voices. He must be under one of the several security posts lining the walls of the palace. They must have made arrangements to let in fresh air into the tunnel. But the structure allowed only air to pass. It was not possible to get down into the tunnel from above. Nor was it possible to get out of the tunnel at that point. The thought that he had entered the Kadambur Palace and the gush of cool air filled his mind with enthusiasm. The end of the tunnel could not be far from here. Would that be the underground treasury? Would Sambuvaraiyar keep loads of gems, diamonds, pearls and gold coins in his treasury? Would he be seeing the human skeletons in the treasury as he saw in Pazhuvettaraiyar’s palace? Would the spiders living here too have spun a web over the mounds of gold coins? As Vandhiya Thevan was engrossed in this speculation, his feet felt something. He was shocked. Then he found out that they were steps and felt relieved. Yes, he was going to climb up the stairs and then see Sambuvaraiyar’s treasury. Or else it would be the ladies chambers in the palace. Oh My God! Then I’d be finished. Ah! I almost forgot! Kandhanmaran’s sister. Manimekalai. The dark beauty. She will be there. When Vandhiya Thevan remembered that at one time he had plans of marrying that girl, a smile escaped from his mouth. There was nobody to watch his beautiful smile. What if he appeared before the ladies of the Palace when they were dressing up! Vandhiya Thevan laughed. The next moment his blood froze. His heart stopped beating. His eyes bulged out. Oh My God! What a blood-chilling scene! He had been climbing the stairs. As soon as he reached the top, when he was sure there were no further steps, he looked around to see where he was. Hundreds and hundreds of fiery eyes were staring at him. The eyes belonged to wild beasts of the forest. At first he decided to run away. He decided to retrace his steps back to the Ayyanar temple. But there was no way to go. When he reached the top step he heard a sound. Perhaps the tunnel closed down on its own. But what a horrible sight! So many wild beasts were waiting to devour him. There were tigers, leopards, lions, bears, bison, wolves, foxes and even rhinoceroses. And there were two elephants too. The animals were ready to pounce on him. But why they have not done that yet? Oh My God! What a huge vulture. The gigantic owl. Bats that could swallow a full human being. Was he dreaming? And there was a crocodile with its mouth open baring its lethal teeth. But crocodiles would normally be in water. This was dry ground. How did the crocodile come in the midst of the wild animals? “Thank God!” Vandhiya Thevan shouted. For only then did he realise that the beasts around him were not alive. He remembered his friend Kandhanmaran talking about his ancestors’ passion for hunting wild animals. He also remembered his friend describing the ’Hunter’s Hall’ in their palace where some of the animals hunted by the members of the Royal Household were on display  \\x0cas stuffed carcasses. Vandhiya Thevan now realised that he had just entered that hall. In spite of that knowledge, it took some time for his body to stop shivering. He went to every animal and touched it. He tried to move them. He even tried to kick them. Thus he made sure that none of the animals were alive. Then he started planning his course of action. The way through which he came had been sealed. Should he go back and find the way out? Or should he try to find out where was this Hunters’ Hall located in the Kadambur Palace? Or should he attempt to find if the way led to some other chamber of the Palace? He searched the walls in vain for possible exit points. With the passing of time Vandhiya Thevan became more and more furious. Why the hell did I venture into this pointless exercise and get trapped? As he was walking along the walls he saw the face of an elephant embedded on the wall. The face had a trunk and the tusks. “Go to hell, damned elephant! It was because you started moving that I got trapped in this underground dungeon.”  He shouted at the dead elephant. The elephant remained silent. Even living elephants would have talked back. How can the stuffed carcass of an elephant respond to his question? It did not even move its trunk. “Why are you silent? Didn’t you hear my question?”  Vandhiya Thevan firmly held the tusks and turned them around. The next moment a miracle happened there. As soon as the tusks were turned one of the elephant’s ear moved. It then folded and showed a gaping hole in the wall. Vandhiya Thevan was surprised beyond words. He put his face into the hole and looked around. He saw a young lady’s face. The lady was dark and beautiful. Her large eyes were wide open. Surprise of surprises! He saw his own face next to the woman’s face; close enough to be able to kiss her. The woman’s eyes - which were wide open - opened wider still and expressed a feeling of surprise which could not be transcribed in words. There was also a little fear in that expression. She paused briefly and she moved her red, pearly lips and shouted “Kooooooooooo”. Vandhiya Thevan was shocked. He instinctively took his hands off the elephant’s tusks. The next minute, the small gaping hole became the wall. There was no hole, no woman. Nor could he hear the “Kooooooooooooo” sound which resembled the sound of a group of beetles. It took some time for Vandhiya Thevan to become his normal self. He started thinking about the frightening scene he just witnessed. Chapter 6 - Manimekalai  Manimekalai, the darling daughter of King Sambuvaraiyar had always been a pampered child. Her father, mother and her elder brother Kandhanmaran showered their love on her. She was virtually a despot in Sambuvaraiyar’s Palace. Her slightest whims became the unwritten law within the four walls of the Palace. Till very recently Manimekalai’s life was made up of song, dance and sheer happiness. She had her first setback in life only a few months ago. Her people forced her to do something which she strongly detested. She had been trying hard to teach the elders in her family a basic lesson of life - ‘Obstinacy never helps’. She failed miserably. For the past two years whenever her brother Kandhanmaran returned from war he would tell her about Vandhiya Thevan. He would sing praises of his valour, his brave acts of war and his intelligence. He used to tell her that Vandhiya Thevan was as handsome as the Love God himself, as valiant as the legendary King Arjuna of Mahabharata and as great a strategist as Lord Krishna himself. “He is the right man for you. He is the one who can break you, tame you and rid you of all your monkey business.”  Manimekalai loved to hear about Vandhiya Thevan. But she would feign anger in her voice and fight with her brother. “Why do you keep raving about him all the time? Bring him here one day. Let me see how good he is.”  \\x0c“Done, sis.”  Manimekalai started seeing Vandhiya Thevan through the eyes of her fertile imagination. She talked to him, laughed with him, played with him, fought with him and then reconciled too - all in the grand castle built in her mind. She was living with him in the hassle-free world of imagination. At times she would describe him to her close friends. Four months ago her dream-castle and her dreams were destroyed by the turn of events. Kandhanmaran’s tone and voice were way different now. “Vandhiya Thevan has no home, no post and no status. Forget that orphan, Sister.”  He told her that his mission was to see her as the Chozha Empress sitting on the famous Thanjavur Throne. He revealed his plans to her. Madhuranthakan, an heir apparent to the Chozha throne, had already married the daughter of Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar. Kandhanmaran told his sister that she had to become Madhuranthakan’s second wife. He was sure that Madhuranthakan was going to be the next Chozha Emperor. And if only Manimekalai married him she could be the Empress of all the three worlds. Perhaps the child born of her might become the Emperor one day. Manimekalai’s parents endorsed Kandhanmaran’s words. But Manimekalai was boiling. Even without being seen by her Vandhiya Thevan had stolen her heart. She could not think of anybody else in his place. Manimekalai knew that Madhuranthakan was a coward who had never seen a battlefield in his life. Till very recently he had been smearing holy ash all over his body, wearing beads on his neck and telling the world that one day he was going to become a saint. This could be pardoned. But the unpardonable fact was that he had already been married. Manimekalai had learnt that the women of the Thanjavur Palace are very proud. They thought they were the only cultured people in the whole Kingdom and looked down upon women from other parts of the Empire. Manimekalai was irritated. Even if she were to get the Thanjavur throne, or for that matter the celestial throne itself, she told her people in no uncertain terms that she would never marry Madhuranthakan. Another piece of information hardened her stand. When the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar came to Kadambur a few months ago she heard that his newly married wife the Junior Queen had also come along. But the Junior Queen never visited the ladies’ chambers of the Palace. At first this was surprising. And a little hurting too. The women of the Kadambur Palace started talking ill of the Junior Queen. They even despised her. And then slowly the truth came out. Manimekalai came to know that the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur was not in the closed palanquin that had come to the Palace. It was Madhuranthakan. Manimekalai’s hatred for the Prince went sky high. “Chee... that coward travelled in a closed palanquin disguised as a lady! And they want me to marry him! Never!”  At the same time that Madhuranthakan was smuggled into the Palace in a closed palanquin, Vandhiya Thevan had also arrived. Kandhanmaran had brought him to the ladies chambers only for a short time. Manimekalai became shy all of a sudden. She stood behind the other women and stole glances of her dream-lover. She did not even have the chance of looking him directly on his face. And yet Vandhiya Thevan’s smiling face got etched into her heart. His voice and the few words he spoke got embedded in her mind. Manimekalai then reopened the arguments with her brother. She told him clearly that even if the three-eyed Lord Shiva were to appear before her and command her to marry Madhuranthakan she would not budge. Though she had seen Vandhiya Thevan only for a short time, she hinted to her brother that her heart was lost to him. Kandhanmaran was furious. At first he spoke softly trying to convince her. But when all his attempts failed he burst out. “Vandhiya Thevan is not my friend. He is my enemy. He tried to kill me by stabbing me in the back. And if you try to marry him I’ll kill you both.”  He showed the stab-wound to his sister. He also told her that it was only because of the Junior Queen Nandini’s kindness that he was restored to life. “And if you have even a morsel of love in your heart towards your only sibling please forget Vandhiya Thevan.”  Manimekalai’s heart changed. She loved her brother Kandhanmaran more than anybody else in the world. It was impossible to marry somebody who was her brother’s avowed enemy, somebody who tried to kill her brother by stabbing him in the back. At the same time it was not possible for her to forget Vandhiya Thevan. Vandhiya Thevan’s smiling face would appear in her heart at the most unexpected time. The face came while she was day-dreaming. The face  \\x0cdominated her nocturnal dreams as well. All these robbed Manimekalai of her natural enthusiasm and happiness. She was depressed all the time. The elders thought that the depression was because of the delay in her marriage. Her friends in her age group made fun of her. Some tried to lift her moods by fun and frolic. None of their ideas worked. Manimekalai started regaining her enthusiasm after some time. She was relieved to know that her parents and her brother had abandoned the idea of marrying her to Madhuranthakan. They were now discussing her marriage with the Crown Prince Adithya Karikalan. There was nobody in Tamilnadu, man or woman, who did not know about the valour and accomplishments of Adithya Karikalan. They also knew that for some reason Karikalan had been delaying his marriage. Well, to marry somebody like Adithya Karikalan... it was an honour one cannot even dream of. Many princesses in the country were longing to be his wife. Manimekalai was enthused by this new development. When she learnt that Adithya Karikalan from Kanchi and the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar from Thanjavur were going to visit their Palace she became her old enthusiastic, happy self once again. This time the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar was bringing his new wife for real. Manimekalai was overawed by Nandini. She was the one who saved her brother’s life. She had heard a lot about Nandini’s beauty, her intelligence and her qualities from her brother Kandhanmaran. Her brother had also told her that she was the one who opened talks of matrimonial alliance with the Crown Prince. Kandhanmaran had also told her that when the Junior Queen stayed in their palace Manimekalai should be personally taking care of her. Manimekalai loved the assignment. She had her own reasons. She wanted to be friends with Nandini and learn the latest fashion tricks of the proud Thanjavur ladies and later beat them in their own game in their home ground. Hence for the past one week Manimekalai was not just enthusiastic but was excited. She was busy making arrangements for the Royal guests. She concentrated on the portion allotted to Nandini. She made sure that nothing was left out. Her brother was repeatedly insisting the need for providing top class hospitality to Nandini. Manimekalai gave hell to the workers of the Palace. She also tortured her friends. Every object placed in Nandini’s room was shifted at least thirty times. Manimekalai frequented the chambers reserved for Adithya Karikalan and his friends quite often. She had heard that Adithya Karikalan was coming along with his friend Parthibendra Pallavan. ‘How will his friend be? Will he remain loyal and faithful to the Crown Prince? Or will he betray him? Who will change when, nobody knows. My brother’s friend Vandhiya Thevan originally belonged to Adithya Karikalan’s camp. If only he had not become a foe, if only he had not betrayed her brother, he too would have come here now. Though Manimekalai made herself busy with a host of exciting activities, she could not completely forget that lovable traitor. Manimekalai heard that the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur, Nandini, would arrive on that day. She checked the chambers reserved for Nandini one last time. She came before the mirror leaning on the wall. She saw her face in the mirror. She was lost in thoughts. Her beauty was no less than the most beautiful woman of her times. The thought made her contented. When she decided to move away from the mirror she saw another face in the mirror. And the other face was very close to hers. Close enough to brush against her cheeks. That was the face of the warrior of the Vana Clan - Vandhiya Thevan - which was troubling her in her waking state as well as in her dreams. Before she could realise what was happening her mouth raised a strange sound. “Kooooooooooooooooo”. The other face vanished. Chapter 7 - The Monkey Without A Tail  Manimekalai thought for a while. She clearly remembered seeing somebody. Was it an apparition or a mere hallucination? Or was she dreaming? If it were a dream she should be in a state of sleep. She pinched herself. It hurt. No, she was not sleeping. This is the personal chamber being made ready for the stay of the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur. Yes, she could now clearly see her face in that marble-mirror. And there the oil lamp was burning. She looked at the wall opposite to the mirror. She now remembered. There is a secret passage on the wall opposite to the marble-mirror. The doors to the passage could be opened either from this chamber or from the other end. Manimekalai placed her ears close to the wall and listened. The door to the secret passage was made of wood. She could hear some sound from the Hunters’ Hall which was on the other side of the door. She gently opened the door to the passage. She peeped into the Hunters’ Hall to have a glimpse. A major part of the hall was plunged in darkness. There was a small oil lamp in the corner of the hall. Suddenly the light from the lamp faded. After a second or so it became bright again. Something must have gone past the lamp. That explained the sudden fading of the light. The face of the figure that blocked the light from the lamp..... Oh My God... did I see that face in the mirror a little while ago? Or have I started seeing sights which others don’t see? Am I hallucinating? While still peering into the hall Manimekalai clapped her hands. “Who’s there?” - she asked in a soft voice. She could hear somebody clearing their throat. A bat which was hanging on the roof flew to the other end of the hall. And then she heard a very light coughing sound. While still remaining there she shouted for her maid “Chandramathi….. “  “Why, Amma? Any problem?”  “Take a lamp and come here. Right now.”  A few seconds later a maid appeared with a lamp in her hand. “Why do you need a lamp here, Amma? The room is already well lit.”  “I want to go into the Hunters’ Hall.”  “There will be nothing but a few bats fluttering their wings.”  “No. A few minutes ago as I was seeing this mirror I saw a face near mine.”  “How did the face look like? Was that the face of Love God? Or the legendary Arjuna of Mahabharata?” - The maid laughed. “Hey Chandramathi, are you teasing me?”  \\x0c“No, Amma. You always talk about a face which you frequently see in your dreams. Perhaps the same person appeared in the mirror.”  “Yes, you are right. But this time it was real.”  “Almost all girls lose their minds at a stage in their lives. Your hallucination will continue for another two, three days. When you see the Crown Prince the old face will vanish forever.”  “Let’s have a look at the Hunters’ Hall now. Come.”  “That’s sheer waste, Amma. The Hall will be full of dust. You’ll spoil your nice saree.”  “I don’t mind.”  “You’ll start to cough and sneeze. Remember all those people are coming tomorrow.”  “Let them come. We’ll have to check the Hunters’ Hall right now. Hold the lamp carefully. Guard the flame. Let it not go off when we are there.”  Manimekalai entered the Hunters’ Hall. The maid followed her with a lamp in  \\x0cher hand. They were slowly looking around the large hall. Chandramathi focussed on the lifeless animals above the lamp while Manimekalai’s eyes swept across the hall occasionally looking down on the floor for any sign of recent disturbance. She made a mental note of fresh foot prints on the mud floor. “Amma! Look there.”  “What? Why are you shouting?”  “That monkey without a tail appeared to move a little.”  “Perhaps it is happy to see you, dear.”  “Why are you teasing me, Amma?”  “Didn’t you tease me that I had gone crazy and hallucinating images of men?”  “Perhaps you must have seen the same monkey’s face in the mirror. See, the monkey is right opposite to the entrance of the hall. See, Amma, the monkey is moving again.”  “No, it’s the shadow caused by your lamp. When the shadow moves it appears to you as if the monkey is moving. Come let’s go. I don’t see anybody here.”  \\x0c“Then, Amma, you must have seen only the monkey’s face in the mirror. Or else it must be the face of that owl. The one sitting on the top. See how he stares at us!”  “Why do you include me with you? The owl is bowled over by your beauty and is staring at you.”  “Then what did you see in the mirror?”  “Do you think I am crazy? The same face which appears in my dreams appeared in this mirror. After having seen that handsome face, I feel bad to see this monkey and the owl. Come let’s go. Let me see if I can see the face again in the mirror.”  The two girls retraced their steps and entered the personal chambers laid out for the Junior Queen. Vandhiya Thevan came out from behind the monkey without tail. He sneezed two, three times to get out the dirt and dust that had gone into his system. He then expressed his gratitude to the tailless monkey which had shielded him from the ladies. “O’ Monkey, may you live long! When that stupid maid compared my face to yours, I was furious. I even thought of stepping out. Thank God, I changed my mind at the last moment. If only you had not been here, what would have happened to me? I would have been caught by those girls. Monkey, may you be blessed.”  \\x0cEven while saying these words a part of his mind reminded him that even if he was caught by the girls nothing untoward would have happened. He had guessed their identities. He could clearly hear their conversation. Manimekalai spoke in a loud, clear voice. Didn’t she say about the face she saw in the dream and the one she saw in the mirror? What was she talking about? His friend Kandhanmaran had told him that he used to share stories about him with his sister. Last time when he came to this Palace, Kandhanmaran had told him that she was going to be married off to some groom of high stature. Perhaps this crazy girl had not yet changed her mind. Oh My God! There was no time to consider the feelings of that soft girl. He had to find a way out of the dark chamber. If he used the lever in the shape of the elephant’s tusk it opened the way to the ladies’ chambers. Now that way would not be useful for his purpose. He knew very well that the lever to open a secret door from inside would be different from the level used to open the door from outside. Now he had to find out the exact levers. But before that he should know where the secret passage was  He was staring at the wall for a long time. No secret passage was visible. The light was not sufficient. Then he remembered seeing a crocodile near the place where he entered this place. If only he went there and examined the wall perhaps he might find a way out of this maze. He went near the embalmed crocodile and felt the surrounding walls with his hands. He could find nothing. As time passed he became more and more anxious. ‘Oh My God’ Vandhiya Thevan shuddered. He was now trapped in the underground dungeons. There was no way out but for the ladies’ chambers. Even that was dangerous. Perhaps Manimekalai might have a soft corner for him. But how could he explain his presence there in the ladies chambers of Sambuvaraiyar’s Palace? ‘Can I say that my love for you brought me here? I could not remain without seeing you. Will that not be a very cruel lie? Even if I harden my heart to tell that kind of a lie will she believe me? And what was the guarantee that Manimekalai will be alone in the chambers? If I am is caught amongst a group of palace girls? If the news reaches Sambuvaraiyar, he won’t think twice before killing me.’  Vandhiya Thevan’s eyes looked at the embalmed crocodile lying on the floor. He was furious. “Oh Crocodile, why are you keeping your mouth so widely open?” He kicked the crocodile pretty hard. The crocodile moved a little. At the same time a small gap opened up on the floor near the wall. “Oh, you were the one blocking the way so far. You idiot crocodile! Why didn’t you tell me earlier?”  Vandhiya Thevan bent down and moved the crocodile further. As the crocodile moved, the hole near the wall became larger and larger. A flight of stairs became visible. Chapter 8 - Two Hands In The Dark  Vandhiya Thevan was awestruck by the way the secret passages and their entrances and exits were planned in Sambuvaraiyar’s Palace. If a person not familiar with those secret passages dared to venture into one of them, well, he was as good as dead. Vandhiya Thevan was now half way down the steps and if for any reason the crocodile is moved then he would be trapped in the hole. His fate would be sealed. So Vandhiya Thevan first made sure that the crocodile did not move on its own. Only then did he place his feet on the steps in the passage. ‘Oh My God! I am now hearing the sound of footsteps from the other end. From the place where I entered this tunnel. Who is coming? Is it Azhwarkkadian? Is he coming for me? I should not let him come here now. He will be in trouble. No, it’s just not one person coming. I can hear the footsteps of about five or six people. Then it must be Idumban Kari and his partners.’  Vandhiya Thevan sprang from his place. The next moment he was hiding behind the monkey without a tail. ‘Oh My God! I have kept the secret passage open. Will that make those people suspicious? No way. Even when I came in the passage was open. It got closed on its own only when I climbed up to the top-most step. In a way it’s better that the passage is open. Yes, there I can see a head emerging from the hole. Yes, it is Idumban Kari’s. He is now on the top most step. He is looking around. He has one foot on the step below. Perhaps he does not want the hole to close on its own while he is there. Good Heavens! I see light on this side of the wall. The elephant fixed on the wall has started to move. The door to the ladies’ chambers is open. Who is coming by that way? Oh My God! Manimekalai is coming again. She is holding a lamp. Idumbankari springs up from where he is standing. The hole through which he emerged closes on its own. Idumbankari removes the piece of cloth and tries to dust the embalmed tiger near him. Oh My God! How and when will this drama end?’  Manimekalai lifted the lamp high and looked around. Her eyes rested on Idumban Kari. There was an expression of surprise on her face. Idumban Kari stopped dusting and looked back at the Kadambur Princess. “Your Highness! At this time? What happened?”  “Is that you, Idumba? What are you doing here?”  “Your Highness, the royal guests might want to look at the Hunters’ Hall. I am trying to keep the hall as clean as possible. Prince has issued orders to that effect before he left for Kanchi.”  “Yes, Idumba. The Prince believes only you and me in the whole palace. I was just checking the room we have got ready for the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur. I heard some noises from here. I thought you should be here. For who else knows the secret passages of this Palace better than you, Idumba? How long have you been working here, Idumba?”  \\x0c“About thirty minutes, Your Highness. I have about another thirty minutes of cleaning-work here. But Your Highness why did you come alone? What happened to that chatterbox, Chandramathi?”  “I was worried about the noises coming from here. So I have sent her to fetch my father. Now that I know that you are here I’ll stop her.”  Manimekalai lifted the lamp to study the change of expression in Idumban Kari’s face. Then she looked at the monkey without a tail. She also saw the animal making a slight movement as it did on an earlier occasion. “You are right, Your Highness. The King has so much on his plate. You may please retire for the day. I’ll take care of the work, Your Highness.”  Manimekalai retraced her steps to the chamber. The secret door closed. Idumban Kari went near the face of the elephant and placed his ear on the wall. Once he was sure that the other room was quiet he came back and opened the hole. He went down the steps. His hip was at the floor level. He could hear an owl hooting from inside the hole. Idumban Kari too hooted like an owl to return the signal. Vandhiya Thevan could now hear the sound of footsteps approaching the hole. Things started to move pretty fast after that. A bat flew across the hall noisily fluttering its wings. Idumban Kari saw the bat. The very next second the monkey without a tail fell on him. The fall was quite sudden and the least expected. Idumban Kari lost his balance. His knees folded. He was forced to go two steps down. He did not know what hit him. He tossed his hands as if to get rid of something. His mouth was uttering some gibberish as he was frantically waving his hands. Finally he found that the embalmed tail-less monkey had fallen on him accidentally. He now regained his courage and tried to restore the monkey to its original place. Meanwhile what looked like a pair of human hands appeared from above the monkey-figure and tried to push him further down. Idumbankari could not believe his eyes. He was frightened. He looked up and down. He noticed that the tail-less monkey had entered the hole head down. Half of the monkey’s body had disappeared. And the door to that hole was closing in on the monkey. He was now sure that what appeared as human hands must be his hallucination. By that time, the others had come close. Ravidasan led the pack. “Hey, why did you scream? You were talking some gibberish. Any danger? Do you want us to go now?”  “No, no. Nothing. There are no dangers. As I was opening the door to the hole this giant-size embalmed monkey fell on me. I was scared. Now this monkey is blocking our way. Give me a few seconds. Let me move the monkey and clear the way for us to go.”  Even now, Lady Fortune favoured Vandhiya Thevan. When Idumban Kari was in the hole looking at the flying bat, Vandhiya Thevan pushed the tail-less monkey on him. And then he hid his face behind the monkey and used his hands to push him further down. And finally he moved the crocodile as well. He did all these in a matter of seconds and ran back to the face of the elephant. He got hold of the elephant’s tusks and turned them with all his might. An opening appeared on the wall. But it was not as wide as the entrance from inside  \\x0cthe ladies’ chambers. This was much narrow. Probably there was a door within a door. Vandhiya Thevan did not have the time to find out the way to open the door fully. He had to enter that small opening before the crowd of conspirators came to the Hunters’ Hall. Otherwise he could never escape from them. So he decided to slide through the narrow passage. He squeezed himself into that circular hole. His head, hands and half of his trunk went in. He could not squeeze in the other half of his body. There was nothing to hold on to. At that time the lamp in the room had been put off and darkness surrounded him. Vandhiya Thevan shouted for help:  “Chandramathi! Chandramathi! Help! Please save me! I am dying.”  He heard a woman laughing aloud. “Oh My God, Chandramathi are you here? What are you looking at? Why are you not helping me? Is it fair? Is it good?”  “Your entering the ladies chambers by stealth is neither fair nor good.” The woman’s voice was firm. Vandhiya Thevan now realised that the voice belonged to Manimekalai. But he feigned ignorance. “Chandramathi, I came in here because you wanted me to come. People are behind me. Please pull me in. Otherwise I’ll be killed.”  “Is Chandramathi so smart? Ok. Let her come. I’ll teach her a lesson as well.”  “Oh, then you must be Princess Manimekalai. Your Highness, I beg of you, please forgive me. And save me from danger. I promise you I won’t indulge in such acts again. May you be always blessed, Princess.”  Two slender hands reached for Vandhiya Thevan’s mighty shoulders. The hands held the shoulders and then gently pulled him down to the floor of the ladies chamber. The opening in the wall closed on its own. “A hundred million thanks to you, Princess.”  “Your thanks can wait till you know what I am going to do to you.”  “Whatever you do is okay with me Your Highness. You have rescued me from those damned killers. That’s more than enough for me. Having escaped death from the hands of those heartless demons, to die at your beautiful hands is a great blessing.”  “Oh My God! You talk like a warrior. Now tell me about the killers who are after you. But before that let me have a look at your face. “Why should you see my face, Your Highness? When you were looking at the marble mirror a monkey’s face appeared from behind. And that face is mine, Your Highness.”  Vandhiya Thevan could hear the sound of bangles and the sound of the Princess laughing. When Vandhiya Thevan had stuck his head into the ladies chamber earlier, Manimekalai had covered the lamp in the room. And now she removed the cover. The lamp glowed again. When she saw Vandhiya Thevan’s face she forgot herself. A group of people were entering the Hunters’ Hall at the same time. Chapter 9 - The Dog Barked  Manimekalai froze. Her eyes were fixed on Vandhiya Thevan’s face. Vandhiya Thevan smiled. What can I tell this girl? How can I get away from her? At that time a voice called from a distance and broke Manimekalai’s trance. “Amma, did you call me?”  “No. I didn’t.” Manimekalai shouted back. Manimekalai went near the hole from which Vandhiya Thevan emerged. She locked the door. She then signalled to Vandhiya Thevan to follow her and took him to the other end of the room. She suddenly turned back and asked him:  “Now is the time to tell the truth. You said Chandramathi asked you to come here? Is that true?”  \\x0c“Yes, Your Highness.”  “When and where did she see you?”  “Just a little while ago. I was standing behind the monkey. You saw the monkey and then went back. After you turned back she told me, “Monkey, can you come to my chambers? It’ll be easy for me to frighten away the unwanted guests. Perhaps you didn’t hear her.”  Manimekalai smiled. “If I had heard I would have blasted her.”  “Why are you angry with her, Princess? If my face closely resembles that of the tail-less monkey, poor girl, what can Chandramathi do?”  “Your face is nowhere near that of the monkey. It’s far from that.”  “Perhaps as far as the owl hanging above the monkey.”  “Your face is neither that of the monkey, nor of the owl. But you are as naughty as the monkey. At times you blink your eyes like an owl. Did you stick your head out through this marble mirror a few minutes ago?”  \\x0c“Yes, Your Highness. I did.”  “Then why did you retreat and close the door?”  “I saw an angel’s face very close to mine. I thought that the angel might be scared if she saw my face. I lifted my hands from the elephant’s tusk. The door closed on its own.”  “Do you know who that angel was?”  “I did not know at that time. And then I thought it over. I got her right.”  “What do you know about her?”  “The one I saw was no ordinary angel. In fact, I saw a Goddess whose feet are fit to be worshipped by all the angels. The darling daughter of King Sambuvaraiyar, the one and only Princess Manimekalai Devi. The only sister of my dearest friend, Kandhanmaran.”  Manimekalai arched her eye-brows. She smiled. But it carried an expression of hatred, fury and derision. “Oh, is that so? Is my brother your dearest friend?”  \\x0c“Do you doubt it, Devi? What is there to doubt? Do you remember my coming here about four months ago? I even visited the ladies’ chambers to pay respect to the senior queens of this palace. Have you forgotten that, Devi?”  “Oh, I remember. How can I forget that so soon? So you are then the great Vallavaraiyan Vandhiya Thevan, the famed Prince of the Vaana clan.”  “Yes, Your Highness. I neither have a country to rule nor a Palace to live. And yet I bear that high-sounding title “Araiyan” which in Tamil means the King. Yes, Devi. That’s the name of our clan. And I am the poor man you are referring to. At one time your brother used to talk a lot about you. That was when we worked together as part of the security force guarding the banks of the North Pennai River. I too had so many dreams, Your Highness. But then I lost them all.”  A strange thought appeared in Manimekalai’s mind. ‘My brother Kandhanmaran said that this man tried to stab him. Why should he do that? Was it because of me? Kandhanmaran must have said that Vandhiya Thevan can’t dream of marrying me. Vandhiya Thevan must have been dejected and disappointed. And he must have picked up fight with my brother.’  The thought filled her mind with a strange kind of pleasure. Manimekalai struggled hard to mask that pleasure and express that as her fury. “There is no need to remind me of the old stories. Tell me why you entered this Palace by stealth. Don’t make me send for my father.”  \\x0c“Didn’t I tell you, Devi? Some killers are after me. As I was running away from them I saw a hole in the ground. I thought it was a secret passage. All my escape-routes were sealed. I had to get into that secret passage. And that brought me here.”  “Well, you are one of the bravest warriors I have ever seen. And I have seen thousands. And have heard about millions. But never in my past have I heard about a warrior who is great when it comes to fleeing the enemy. The legendary Utharakumaran of Mahabharatha should take lessons from you. On fleeing from the battle-front.”  Vandhiya Thevan bit his tongue. He had thought of Manimekalai as an imbecile. The girl was quite sharp. She was making fun of him. “Devi, they were seven or eight people. I am fighting them all alone. They are armed to their necks. I don’t have any weapon with me. My spear was washed away in floods at the Coleroon River.”  “In a way it’s good. That was a treacherous spear. It could stab a dear friend from the back. It’s good that it was washed away in the floods.”  Vandhiya Thevan was shocked. Before he could think of a response Manimekalai thundered:  “Now is the time to tell the truth. Why did you come here? You were running away from your killers? Or have you come here to kill somebody?”  \\x0cVandhiya Thevan felt as if he had placed his foot on fire. “OH MY GOD! SHIVA SHIVA! NARAYANA! I have come here to kill whom? Do you think I’ll kill my dear friend’s darling sister? What for?”  “Who knows? I don’t know how you still manage to say “my dear friend”? Didn’t you try to stab that dear friend on his back? Why? Perhaps you’ve come here for a similar purpose now. To stab somebody on their back.”  “Oh My God! May the good heavens have some mercy on me! Did I stab Kandhanmaran? If I were forced to do that I’ll rather cut my hands than doing that meanest act of betrayal. Princess, who had the heart to utter those damned lies?”  “Who else but my own brother? If somebody else had said that I would not have believed it.”  “Did Kandhanmaran say that? Then I am really unfortunate. Somebody stabbed him on his back and had ditched him near the walls of Thanjavur Fort. He was unconscious. I lifted him up and carried him to Chendhan Amudhan’s hut. I made sure that he recovered well. And now I have been amply rewarded for my work. Princess, tell me this at least. Why should I kill my dear friend? Did he offer any reason?”  “Yes, he did. You called me ugly. You had told him that the women in the Thanjavur Palace are real beauties. Kandhanmaran was furious and he slapped  \\x0cyou. And you did not have the courage to fight him face to face. So you hid behind him and stabbed him on his back. Tell me is that true or not?”  “Lie! Absolute falsehood! Before calling you ugly I would have plucked my tongue out of my mouth. It was only your brother who insisted that I should forget you forthwith.”  “But why?”  “He said that a number of reigning emperors are in the queue to marry you. So he insisted that I should forget you.”  “And you listened to him, right?”  “Honestly I could not forget you altogether. From then on I’ve been seeing you as my dear sister, Princess. Please take me to Kandhanmaran immediately. Or else call him here. Let me know why he uttered such a big lie. If the thinks that as the truth, I’ll change his mind. Please, Devi...”  “Whatever mission you started in Thanjavur you want to complete it here in Kadambur, right?”  “I don’t get you, Devi.”  “You tried to kill him there. You didn’t succeed. So...”  \\x0c“Oh My God! Do you think that I am such a fool to come to his own palace to kill him?”  “Then why did you choose the secret passage?”  “Now please listen. My killers are still in the next room. You can hear the footsteps and voices.”  “Why should they kill you?”  “They look like sorcerers. Perhaps they want to offer a human sacrifice. And they have chosen me.”  “Oh, that’s why they identified somebody who has all the markings of Royal blood.” Manimekalai laughed. “That surprises me as well. Why should they come for somebody with the face of a monkey and the eyes of an owl? After listening to you I have a doubt. Perhaps my dear friend Kandhanmaran has given orders to them. Please take me to your brother, Devi. He can either clear his doubts. Or else let him kill me with his own hand. Why should he hire killers, Devi? Please call Kandhanmaran immediately.”  “You need not be in such a great hurry. For Kandhanmaran is not in town.”  \\x0c“Where is he?”  “He has gone to Kanchi to fetch the Crown Prince Karikalan. They will all be here tomorrow night. Till then… you… “  “Till then you want me to stay here? No, Devi. That is not proper.”  “No. I never said that. The Junior Queen of Pazhuvur will come here shortly. Then even air cannot enter this place without proper permission. You know Pazhuvettaraiyar. If he sees you here he’ll simply hack you to death. Oh My God, how the old man loves his wife!”  Manimekalai laughed. Vandhiya Thevan now remembered the events that happened when Pazhuvettaraiyar came to Kadambur earlier. “Oh, is it so? Does Pazhuvettaraiyar love his young wife so much?”  “The whole world knows. Last time when they came here the old man did not allow his Queen to visit us ladies in the palace. He is keeping her in his palm and is taking excellent care of her. This time they are going to stay here for a few days. And they have insisted on separate chambers for the Queen. Will the old man let her see us...? I don’t know.”  \\x0c“Then what should I do, Devi?”  “I am still thinking. Yes! My brother has a dedicated room for his weapons. I’ll take you there. Kandhanmaran will come only tomorrow evening. You can stay there till he comes. When he comes you can prove your side of the story.”  “No, Devi. That’s neither fair nor safe. It’s highly risky.”  “Why risky?”  “If Kandhanmaran asks how I reached that place…. …..”  “Tell him the truth.”  “When I said the truth even you did not believe me, Your Highness. Even when my killers are in the next room you don’t believe my words.”  “Ok, let me verify it myself.”  “What are you going to verify, Your Highness?”  \\x0c“I am going to the Hunters’ Hall and enquire the persons who are there. I want to find out whether they have come to kill you or whether you brought them with you.”  “Oh My God! They are all ruthless killers, Devi. And if you are caught alone with them.... “  “What can they do to me in my own Palace? Have a look at this.”  Manimekalai pulled out a small foldable knife from her hip. “Nobody can come near me. And even if they do, I have a hero like you by my side.”  “But, Devi, I am unarmed now.”  “For the brave and skilful even a blade of grass can be a weapon. And your name - Vallavaraiyan - hints about your skills. With weapons in hand even timid girls can fight. Why do we need a warrior like you? You need not worry at all. There is a person in the Hunters’ Hall who’s cleaning the place. He is our servant. He could have brought the others to help him in his work, in which case I must know them too. Let me find out why they have come here. Don’t stand near the door. Can you see that grain repository? Please stand over there till I come back. Will you?”  Manimekalai went to the door that led to the Hunters’ Hall and tried to open it. Vandhiya Thevan walked fast towards the repository and hid himself. The doors of the repository were open. He looked in. It did not look like a repository for grains. There were steps. And on each step was a music instrument - the Veena, the yaazh and the drums. He looked up. It appeared as if the steps reached up to the ceiling. By that time Manimekalai had entered the Hunters’ Hall. Vandhiya Thevan was quite surprised by her courage. At first he was worried about her safety. But then he consoled himself that she would be quite safe in her own palace. The door of the chamber opened and Chandramathi entered the hall. “Amma... Amma… “  Vandhiya Thevan was shocked. He entered the room of musical instruments to hide from Chandramathi. “Amma, the people from Thanjavur have reached the gates of our Fort. The Queen wants you there. She has sent me to fetch you, Amma.”  Chandramathi looked around and walked towards the door to the Hunters’ Hall which was open. From where she stood, she could have seen Vandhiya Thevan. So he climbed a few steps up. His knees hit a Veena and there was a distinct sound. Vandhiya  \\x0cThevan was shocked and climbed a few more steps. His head hit the ceiling. What a surprise! The ceiling which was a wooden plank moved up further. Vandhiya Thevan grew suspicious and tried to move the wooden plank with his hand. The plank yielded. And he could see the light of an open space. He could hear some sounds at a distance. He could see stars at a distance. Vandhiya Thevan’s heart jumped in joy. He now removed the plank aside and climbed up. He now realised that he had reached the terrace. He also remembered that when he visited the Palace a few months ago he had slept exactly in that place enjoying the cool breeze. It was here that he hid behind the pillars and listened to the deliberations of the assembly of conspirators. Vandhiya Thevan moved the plank again and closed the way through which he climbed up. Only then he realised that it was not easy to locate that passage from the terrace. He did not have the luxury of time to wonder how the passage had been perfectly planned. His first priority was survival - to escape from the Palace unharmed. Lady Luck had been smiling at him all the time. There was a good chance that she would continue to favour him. Vandhiya Thevan looked around. He could see flags and festoons all over the Palace. This is how a Royal reception should be. He walked on the terrace carefully looking in all the directions before taking each step. The terrace was virtually deserted. Vandhiya Thevan thanked his stars and started walking fast. He reached the spot where he had slept for the night when he visited the Palace a few months ago. From his position he could see the outer walls of the palace. He could also see the huge yard inside the palace, the place where the Kuravai Koothu happened at that time, the place where the conspirators had congregated. But there was nobody in those places. Of course it did not require a genius to know why. The Palace gate was abuzz with activity. Hundreds of torches illuminated the place. There were drums and other musical instruments playing at a high pitch. People’s hailing sound pierced the sky. Pazhuvettaraiyar’s retinue had reached the gates and the whole Palace was there to receive the visitors. That explained the absence of people at the place he stood. He could not have got a better opportunity to escape from danger. He could not have got such an ideal opportunity either if he had come ten minutes earlier or ten minutes later. Vandhiya Thevan walked to the spot where the conspirators had assembled. He looked around. There was nobody. He then looked down. There was nobody there. He saw the palace wall. There was nobody. But wait! Oh My God! There is a human face appearing between the branches peering over the wall. It looks like the face of Azhwarkkadian. No, no, that’s just a hallucination! This is exactly the place where I saw his face when I came here earlier. So my mind has deceived me once again. In a way that’s good. That’s the best point to jump over the wall. I need to escape before the crowd comes into the Palace after according a reception to the visiting dignitaries. But first I should get into the yard. How am I going to do it? Well, I can see a thatched shed in the yard. Perhaps they are going to have Kuravai Koothu or some other show. A large bamboo pole buried deep into the ground to support the temporary auditorium stretched up to the terrace. Vandhiya Thevan jumped on to it and slid down to the yard. He looked around. The place was still deserted. He could hear the sound of anklets from the place where he stood before jumping down. That must be Manimekalai. Oh My God! If I am caught by her, my fate is sealed. Vandhiya Thevan ran across the open yard. He went near the wall and turned back. He could see the figure of a lady over the terrace. But he was not sure whether it was Manimekalai or Chandramathi. Whosoever it was, she would have seen him running across the yard. She did not raise an alarm. Whosoever it is, may she be blessed. Vandhiya Thevan walked along the wall after blessing that woman. He reached the spot from where Azhwarkkadian’s face had appeared. But how to scale the wall? It was so high and was perfectly even. A rough, up and down surface would have afforded a perfect grip for him to climb the wall. He then saw a few bamboo poles lying on the ground. That must have been the surplus materials brought for erecting the thatched shed. He quickly picked a long bamboo pole. He made the pole lean on the wall. The pole was almost as high as the wall. Now he could climb the pole and reach the top of the wall. But how would he make the pole stand firm? What would happen if it slipped when he was half way up? Then he would have a great fall. But there was no other way. He tested the strength of the pole and started to climb. When he was half way up, the pole started to hobble and waver. If I fall now all the bones in my body would go for a toss. Suddenly the pole became firm. It looked as if a hand from above was holding the pole tight. Thank God, I’ve not become insane. Vandhiya Thevan continued to climb. When his hands gripped the edge of the wall the pole slipped and fell down. The sound of the pole hitting against the ground appeared like the sound of thunder. Thankfully, the noise at the gate of the Fort was much higher. But the girl standing on the terrace would not have missed the sound. Vandhiya Thevan turned around to look at her. She was still standing in the same position. Even while in the middle of danger his mischievous qualities had not left him. He waved to the girl as if taking leave of her. He then started climbing down the other side of the wall. Climbing down was not that difficult. The branches of the trees nearby helped him. When he thought of how he duped Manimekalai, he laughed out loud. He then heard somebody laughing, as if echoing his laugh. His blood froze. His hands started to tremble. He was just a few steps away from the ground and wanted to jump. There was a dog ready to pounce on him. He had no time to think. He could not climb up the wall again. He had to jump. But if he did, the dog would surely have its pound of flesh. Did he hear somebody laughing or was it the sound of the dog barking? Was the dog sent by somebody who was hiding in the dark? Was it more dangerous to climb up the wall or to climb down? Vandhiya Thevan was in a dilemma. His legs were dangling in the air trying to escape the dog’s mouth which was jumping higher and higher to catch them. Chapter 10 - The Manhunt  Vandhiya Thevan was in a dilemma. Should he jump to the ground deftly evading the dog’s mouth or should he scale up the wall again? He looked around to see if anybody was hidden behind the trees. A white cloth seemed to move behind one of the trees. He remembered having heard somebody laughing. If a man was hidden in the bushes.... Would that be one man or many? To jump to the ground without that information would be the greatest blunder. Even if he managed to escape the dog’s mouth he was sure to be caught by the men. He clearly remembered seeing Azhwarkkadian’s face over the wall when he was on the terrace. Perhaps that Vaishnavite has been bored of waiting at the Ayyanar temple. He has come here and has set the dog after me. Well, why don’t I check that right now? Why don’t I call him? “Oh Vaishnavite! What’s this you are doing?”  He heard somebody laughing once again. That was not Azhwarkkadian’s voice. Vandhiya Thevan now sure that the only way to survive was to scale up the wall again and get back into the Palace. He could easily find a way to hide himself in the elaborate festivities planned for receiving the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar. And then he would have to sweet talk Manimekalai into helping him go out. While doing that he would have to win over the affection of Nandini as well. Nandini had not betrayed him so far. There was no reason why she would do that now. Vandhiya Thevan tried to retrace his steps. He was climbing up the wall. The dog tried to jump higher and higher. He heard the sound of laughter once again. A figure emerged from behind the tree with a spear in the hand. Vandhiya Thevan knew that it was Devaralan, part of the conspiracy group. Devaralan came near Vandhiya Thevan. “Your stars are favourable, Young man. You always escape death at the nick of time.”  “I know that. But tell me, why have you come to me again?”  “Only to tell you, to show you that you can’t escape from me this time.”  Devaralan aimed the spear at Vandhiya Thevan. It was only then that Vandhiya Thevan realised that his life was in danger. How can a man dangling on the wall fight with a person standing on firm ground and that too when the latter was armed with a deadly spear? Well, in theory, he could jump to the ground to escape the spear. But the hunting dog was waiting for its pound of flesh. “Devarala, beware! Remember the orders of your boss, the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur. Didn’t your Queen issue orders not to harm me?”  Devaralan laughed like a devil. “The Queen of Pazhuvur is not my boss. My boss is Bhadrakali, Durga Parameswari. Yes, the Holy Mother alone is my boss.”  “She’s my Holy Mother too. My clan worships her. She is our presiding deity. It was only because of Her grace that I could escape from a burning ship. If you try to touch me, your Holy Mother will destroy you!”  “If you are really a devotee of Durga Parameswari you should help me now. If you do, I won’t harm you.”  “What do you want me to do? But before that, send this damned dog away.”  “I saw a Vaishnava fanatic somewhere around here. If you help me to capture him, I’ll set you free.”  “Why should you capture him?”  “I have vowed to sacrifice a Vaishnava fanatic to Durga Devi.”  Precisely at that time the shrub that Vandhiya Thevan was holding tight for his balance, came off. Vandhiya Thevan was now exploring the possibilities of directly falling on Devaralan in order to escape his spear. “That Vaishnavite is my dear friend. I’ll never betray him. Why don’t you sacrifice me in his place?”  \\x0c“Then be a victim to my spear.” Devaralan lifted the spear and aimed at Vandhiya Thevan. Vandhiya Thevan let the shrub go and jumped under the spear holding its edge. And fell down in the process. Devaralan was shocked. Before he could come out of the shock and lift the spear again, a figure armed with a heavy stick came behind him and hit his head with great force. Devaralan now fell on Vandhiya Thevan. The dog pounced on the person who had attacked its master. Azhwarkkadian was prepared for that as well. He pulled off the cloth above his waist and covered the dog’s face. For a few seconds the dog went blind. Azhwarkkadian pulled out a creeper for a make-shift dog chain. With that creeper he bound the dog to a tree. Meanwhile Vandhiya Thevan pushed Devaralan from him and stood up. A single blow from the Vaishnavite was more than enough to render Devaralan unconscious. Vandhiya Thevan and Azhwarkkadian foraged for some more creepers. They used them to bind Devaralan’s limbs. Vandhiya Thevan took the spear and Azhwarkkadian, his stick. They left the place. Except for the gates all the other sides of Sambuvaraiyar’s Palace were surrounded by thick forest. If somebody accidentally entered these forests it was very difficult to come out of them. The two men knew this very well and hence kept walking close to the walls of the Palace. Azhwarkkadian shouted at Vandhiya Thevan. “I thought you are smart.”  “Are you referring to my entering that tunnel? Do you know how many things I have found out because of that?”  “No, I am not talking about that. When that crook Devaralan asked you ‘Will you help me capture that Vaishnavite?’ you should have said a big “YES”. Why did you refuse and get caught?”  “All because of the company I keep!”  “Are you alluding to me? Have I ever told you to commit these blunders? I don’t think so.”  “I am not referring to you. I am referring to Ponniyin Selvan. After spending time with him, I don’t have the heart to tell lies.”  “Not even to save your life? Have you become such a true soul?”  “That’s not the only reason. I know very well that you were hiding somewhere around here. Suppose I were to tell Devaralan that, I’d betray you and suppose you heard that and suppose you believed that... I don’t think you would have helped me.”  \\x0c“You are very smart, Young Man. There is no doubt about it. Honestly I was anxious to know what answer you were going to give to that difficult question.”  “See, my predictions have become true. I knew you’d doubt anything and anybody. That apart, whatever the benefits I may get, I would never betray a true friend. But you promised to wait for me at Ayyanar Temple. How did you come here? If I had returned through that tunnel I’d have missed seeing you there in the temple.”  “If you had chosen to return by that tunnel you would not have come out alive. Soon after you went in, the conspirators followed suit. I know you are smart. So I thought you’d choose some other way to come out. I even thought that you might choose to jump the wall here.”  “Don’t tell me that you came here fully knowing that I’d choose this exact place to appear!”  “No, that’s not the only reason. The conspirators left Devaralan to guard the entrance of the Ayyanar Temple. They wanted to make sure that nobody is in the temple when they came out of the tunnel. So they had some peculiar signal that I did not know. I thought everyone had entered the tunnel and was also worried that you were caught inside the tunnel. I also wanted to know how to open the tunnel from outside. So I went to the temple’s altar and tried to move it. I heard some footsteps and looked around. Devaralan was coming towards me with a spear. The conspirators had issued orders to kill me wherever and whenever I am seen. I was not armed. I had no alternative than to flee. I was running through a dense forest. He could not catch me. After some time I knew that I had lost him. I thought of taking the high road. There was a small hut at a distance. A small oil  \\x0clamp was the only source of light in the vicinity. I decided to go to the hut to ask for directions to the high road. Thank God I looked at the house carefully! I noticed this devil Devaralan standing there. A woman and a dog were near him. Devaralan spoke something to the woman and then went off along with the dog. The dog sensed my presence and barked in my direction. I was in danger. I abandoned the idea of taking the high road and ran back into the forest. As the dog was continually barking I could guess where the conspirators were going. As I was running away from danger my brain was hyper active. I knew it was impossible to stay in the forest all night. They will somehow find me. And that will be the end of me. At the same it will not be easy to manage Devaralan who was armed with a spear and a hunting dog armed with strong teeth. I happened to see the wall of this great building. I thought that if I could manage to scale the wall and jump into the building then I can somehow manage to escape from the conspirators. And I started climbing up the wall. When I was on top I saw you running across the terrace. I guessed that you will try to come out the Palace by scaling up the wall. So I jumped down on the other side. I was sure that if we joined hands we can manage Devaralan and the dog. I heard the sound of barking and I climbed up a tree. Devaralan and the dog came near the tree. Devaralan saw you getting down the palace wall. He took the dog with him and went running towards you. And you know what happened after that. “Vaishnava, what are your views on the power of destiny?”  “What’s this question? Why should you talk about destiny all of a sudden?”  \\x0c“People say that the moment a person is born Lord Brahma, the Creator, writes his entire life history on his head. Do you believe that?”  “No. I don’t believe in destiny. If destiny is all-powerful then there will be no point in our devotion to God. Do you know what our Azhwars have said about it…? “  “Let the Azhwars wait. I now have complete faith in destiny. Everything is preordained. Otherwise I would not have come out of the palace alive.”  “Young man, you escaped not because of your fate but because of your intelligence.”  “No way! My intelligence led me to unknown dangers. It was my fate which rescued me.”  They had come out of the forest by then. They could see the front entrance of the Kadambur Palace. The place was bustling with activity. The Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s retinue consisting of elephants, horses and infantry had just reached the Palace gates. Sambuvaraiyar and his retinue were waiting at the heavily decorated entrance to receive the visitor. Hundreds of torches had converted night into day. A wide variety of drums and horns were being played. Azhwarkkadian grabbed Vandhiya Thevan’s hand. “Come let’s get out of here  \\x0cbefore somebody sees us.”  “Nobody can recognise us. Even if they do my destiny will save me. Should we not see the glorious sight of the Pazhuvettaraiyar getting down from his elephant?”  “Are you interested only in that?”  “I also want to know whether Nandini has come with him in the elephant or in a closed palanquin.”  “Don’t think fate will favour you always. At times it will come in the form of a seductive witch and upset your life-cart.”  “I can’t be so easily seduced, Vaishnava. There are others who’ll fall for her charms. Not me.”  The majestic elephant came to a stop at the Palace gate. The Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar got down from the pachyderm. Soon the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur, Nandini Devi followed suit. “Oh! This time he has openly taken the queen along with him. She did not come in a closed palanquin.”  There was a tinge of sarcasm in his voice. “I wanted to know only that. Come, let’s go.”  Vandhiya Thevan moved back. This time Azhwarkkadian was not in a hurry. He stood in the same place. He was looking at Nandini without batting his eye-lids. It may have been a mere coincidence or the mind-powers of the Vaishnavite Nandini turned to look at him. Azhwarkkadian’s face was looking at her from the midst of dark trees. The moment she saw his face she became pale. Pazhuvettaraiyar did not fail to notice the sudden change in his wife’s face. He also looked in the same direction. He saw two figures hiding behind the dark shadow cast by the trees. He whispered something into the ears of Sambuvaraiyar. Sambuvaraiyar barked orders to two of his men. Pazhuvettaraiyar and Nandini entered the palace amidst great fanfare. At the same time two horsemen entered the forest just beyond the palace walls. They had to struggle hard to lead their horses into the dark forest. They rode on for a long distance and had reached the clearing beyond the forest. Still they could not find anybody  “There’s nobody in the forest. It’s nothing but the hallucination of the old man.”  At that time they heard the howling of a dog. “Do you know when a dog will howl?” - One of the horsemen asked. “When it sees a devil or a ghost or some supernatural apparition.”  “Perhaps you look like a devil to the dog.”  “No, brother. You look like a ghost.”  They heard a devilish laughter from above. They looked up. There were two ghosts sitting right above the two men in the tree. The two ghosts extended their hands and slapped the two soldiers on their cheeks. The ghosts then placed their hands on the necks of horsemen and pushed them off their horses. Then those naughty ghosts mounted the horses and crossed the forest and rode fast in the clearing. Chapter 11 - Is He A Friend Or A Traitor? The Crown Prince Adithya Karikalan, his friends and his retinue were crossing the beautiful place where River Manimutha merged with River Vellaru. They were discussing the hospitality accorded to them at their last place of visit Thirumudhukunram. They were also discussing the temple renovation work under progress in that village. “I appreciate what Saint Sundaramurthy did at Thirumudhukunram.” Parthibendran opened a conversation. “What did he do?” The Crown Prince was curious. “The Saint refused to sing praises of an old woman.”  “What was that? Tell me the whole story.”  Parthibendran started a long narration. As a part of his pilgrimage the venerated saint Sundaramurthy Nayanar visited a place called Thirumudhukunram presently known as Virudhachalam. The priests of the temple welcomed him and showed him around the temple. “Your Holiness, we entreat you. Please compose some songs on our Lord and Goddess. We’ll deem it a great honour.”  They pleaded with him. “Let’s see. But tell me what the name of your Lord is?” Sundaramurthy asked. The word Thirumudhukunram had a connection with old age. So the Lord of the place was accordingly named as Virthagireeswarar, which literally meant the Old Lord. The Saint’s face fell. ‘Should I sing about an old man?’ He thought. “That’s okay. What’s the name of the Goddess?”  “Viruthagireeswari.”  The word denoted an old Goddess. “You made my God an old man. Ok, let that be. Why have you made my Holy Mother also an old woman?”  The priests did not know how to respond. “No, I won’t sing about an old man and his old lady.” The Saint walked out of the temple in apparent fury. Now the priests were worried. If somebody as great as Sundaramurthy Nayanar did not sing on their deities then their temple would not be considered holy enough for pilgrimage. So they installed another statue of the Goddess and this time carefully named her as Balambikai, which meant a young woman. Having done that they ran to Sundaramurthy and told him about the developments begging him to come to their village and sing on their young Goddess. Sundaramurthy relented. He went back to their village and sang a set of ten songs, called a padhikam in Tamil, on the young Goddess. Adithya Karikalan virtually rolled in laughter after hearing the story. “I think a poet would have told the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar similar to what the Saint told the priests. He would have refused to sing the praises of the old man and his old wife. Perhaps that was the motivation for the old man to marry a young Nandini.”  Parthibendran and Kandhanmaran burst out into laughter. They laughed so much that at one time it appeared as if they were going to fall off from their horses. Parthibendran gathered himself to talk some philosophy. “I don’t know why God created old age. He should have let us be young till our destined time of death. That would have made our lives a lot easier.”  “Whatever may be God’s law, to attain old age or not is in our hands.” The Crown Prince retorted. “I don’t understand, Prince.” - Kandhanmaran questioned. “Do we think of the legendary Abhimanyu and Aravan of Mahabharata as old men?”  The other two were silent. They knew that those two heroes died pretty young. “In the art gallery attached to the Thanjavur Palace we have the paintings of all my ancestors. Vijayalaya Chozha, Adithya Chozha and Emperor Paranthaka appear as old men. But my grandfather’s brother Rajadithya appears as a man in the prime of his youth. Do you know the reason? He died young. So in a way he was blessed with immortal youth. And people know him only as a young man. I don’t know how many of us will have that blessing.”  The other two did not like his words. They remained silent. “Why have you become silent? Are you so afraid of death? If this body goes  \\x0caway we’ll get another. Why should we fear death? If only my friend Vandhiya Thevan were here he will happily endorse my opinion. It is very rare to find somebody as enthusiastic as Vandhiya Thevan. Even if you put him at the door of death he will still be laughing.”  They saw two horses coming in the opposite direction. The horses were galloping very fast creating a cloud of dust as they moved. And in a flash the horses had come near them. The way the horses rode, it appeared as if they might go past them without caring to pay respects to the Crown Prince of the Chozha Kingdom. Kandhanmaran and Parthibendran were eager to know who those arrogant horse-riders were. They got ready to block the riders by wielding their spears across the road. But the horses were stopped at a short distance from them. Vandhiya Thevan and Azhwarkkadian dismounted. The Crown Prince was ecstatic on seeing Vandhiya Thevan. He threw all protocol to winds. He jumped from his horse and went towards Vandhiya Thevan to hold him in a tight hug. “Thambi, you’ll live a hundred years and more. Just a second ago I was talking about you.”  Kandhanmaran and Parthibendran were burning in jealousy at this sudden show of affection. They moved their horses a little away from the Crown Prince. They saw a few more horses coming at a distance. Those horses too stopped near them. Kandhanmaran noticed that the horse riders were from his place, Kadambur. He went near them and made enquiries. He then came to Adithya Karikalan. “Prince, this Vandhiya Thevan is your friend. He was my friend too, once upon a time. But I have to level grave charges against him. He is a traitor. He stabbed me in the back. So, Your Highness, it is my bounden duty to advise you to be very careful with this man.”  \\x0cChapter 12 - The Broken Spear  Kandhanmaran levelled charges against his friend Vandhiya Thevan. Adithya Karikalan laughed out loud. “You mean to say that this Vandhiya Thevan stabbed you on your back, Kandhanmaran? But why did you show your back to him?”  The Crown Prince laughed again. The dark face of Kandhanmaran went red with anger. His eyes became red and his lips quivered. “Prince, do you consider this a laughing matter?”  “Kandhamara! Are you saying that I should not laugh? Laughter is a boon given by God exclusively to human beings. The cow can’t laugh. Nor can the sheep. The horse or the lion can’t laugh. Even monkeys who love to play mischief all the time can’t laugh. Only human beings can laugh. Then why do you want to stop my laugh? Do you know my friend that it’s aeons since I had a hearty laugh? I am surprised by the sound of my own laughter. And you are telling me not to laugh.”  “Prince, Your happiness only makes me happier. But please don’t think that I showed my back to this all-time great warrior. At the most unexpected moment  \\x0chiding behind my back he stabbed me. It was because of the grace of my Holy Mother, Durga Devi and thanks to the kindness of Nandini Devi that I am alive today. I entreat you to please enquire into this blatant act of betrayal and render justice to me. Or at least please give me powers to punish him.”  “My dear friend, please wait. Let me enquire into your charges. I’ll see to it that you get justice. Nobody who has sought justice from a member of the great Sembian clan has returned empty-handed. One of the earliest kings of our clan, Emperor Sibi, cut his flesh in order to save a dove from the clutches of an eagle. Manuneethi Chozhan, another King in our dynasty, sacrificed his own son in order to right the wrong done to a cow. You are not inferior to a dove or a cow. Justice will not be denied to you... But you will have to be patient till I finish my enquiry. “Vandhiya Theva, before you render an account of your travel, you should answer the charge levelled against you by Kandhanmaran. What is your defence for this grave charge? Did you really stab him on his back? And if you did, why did you do that cowardly act of betrayal which is quite unbecoming of a warrior of your stature?”  “Prince, I did not stab this warrior. Stabbing on the back.... I cannot even think of that, Prince. Nor did I hide myself in order to do that act of cowardice. I saw him bleeding and unconscious. I found him stabbed in the back. I bore him on my shoulders and went all the way to Chendhan Amudhan’s house to save him. But I now regret my decision of having saved his life. I regret that I did not kill him by stabbing him on his chest. I am sorry, Your Highness, I let my love for a friend take precedence over loyalty to my King. He accused me of having betrayed a friend. But this man has not only betrayed his friend but his Master as well. Ask him where did that back-stabbing incident happen and under what circumstances. Ask him who he secretly brought to the Thanjavur Palace through the secret tunnel. Ask him whom did he see in the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s treasury. Ask him what happened at the Kadambur Palace on the 18th day of Adi, the day celebrated as Adi Perukku in Tamilnadu. Ask him  \\x0cwho came in the closed palanquin to Kadambur Palace on that day.”  Kandhanmaran trembled. He could not speak clearly. “Stop talking rubbish, lowborn worthless idiot. Otherwise you’ll become a prey to my spear!”  Kandhanmaran took out his spear. Adithya Karikalan was surprised by this sudden display of emotions. He grabbed the spear from Kandhanmaran. And then with his iron hands tried to bend the spear. It broke. The Crown Prince threw away the two pieces of the broken spear. “BEWARE! I CAN’T TOLERATE MY FRIENDS FIGHTING IN MY PRESENCE. PARTHIBENDRA IF ANY OF THESE TWO WIELD A SPEAR OR A SWORD TO ATTACK THE OTHER, IT’S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ARREST THEM.”  Vandhiya Thevan pulled out his sword and gave it to Parthibendran who reluctantly got it from him. “Kandhamara, Vandhiya Thevan has answered your charges. I’ll take my time to verify the truth in his statements and pronounce my judgment. Meanwhile are you going to answer his questions now?”  Kandhanmaran was in a fix. “Your Highness I am under an oath not to disclose or discuss those matters.”  \\x0cParthibendran intervened. “Your Highness, judging from the way these people trade charges I am afraid that the problem centres around a woman. It will be better if you enquire them separately.”  “You are right, Parthiba. I too thought so. All the three of you have fallen in the net of seduction cast by the Pazhuvur Queen. That explains your urgency to destroy each other.”  Parthibendran’s face fell. Yet he wanted to fire his salvos against Vandhiya Thevan. “Your Highness, I presume that today you’ve taken a vow to take serious matters quite lightly and make fun of them. Let that be so. Please give me a chance to explain my side, Your Highness. I have my own doubts on Vandhiya Thevan. I’ll share only the important ones with you. Your dear brother jumped into the sea only to save this man from a burning ship. And we never saw Ponniyin Selvan after that. But this man here is as strong as ever. As hale and healthy as he was when he was caught in the ship. And has suddenly surfaced here. Ask him what happened to your brother. If your brother was drowned in the sea then this man is fully responsible for that.”  Karikalan turned to Vandhiya Thevan - “What’s your answer for this?”  “Before I answer his charge let him answer my question. It was this man who  \\x0ctook Ponniyin Selvan on his ship. Chief Minister Aniruddha Brahmarayar and Lankan General Bhoothi Vikrama Kesari had advised Ponniyin Selvan not to move out of Lanka. But Ponniyin Selvan, out of love and respect for his elder brother, bowed down to his request. He got into this man’s ship. And it was the responsibility of this man to deliver Ponniyin Selvan safely into your hands. Why didn’t he do that? When Ponniyin Selvan jumped in the middle of the sea, why this man remained a silent spectator? Why did not he prevent the Prince from jumping into the sea? “I am a poor man, Your Highness. I am an orphan, Your Highness. And yet Ponniyin Selvan risked his life to save me. This man Parthibendran is a renowned warrior of the Pallava clan. He had a duty to protect the life of our Prince. Ask him why didn’t he or his men jump into the sea to save Ponniyin Selvan?”  Parthibendran was furious. His hands and lips quivered. “Prince, this fool is now accusing me. He might even say that it was I who killed the Prince. I can’t bear this nonsense.”  Karikalan looked deeply into his eyes. “Parthiba, didn’t I tell earlier? You, my dear friends, have become sworn enemies of each other. I am not blaming you. It’s the powers of the Pazhuvur Queen. I have felt those powers myself. Parthiba and Kandhanmaran, you mount on your horses and ride slowly before us. Let me listen to the details of Vandhiya Thevan’s travels. We’ll be following you. I’ll enquire into your charges and find out the truth. But remember one thing. You three have to be friends. There’s nothing which can bring greater sorrow to me than you three fighting with each other.”  \\x0cParthibendra Pallavan and Kandhanmaran reluctantly mounted on their respective horses and started riding forward. Azhwarkkadian came near Vandhiya Thevan and whispered into his ears:  “You have become very smart. You did not tell the truth. Nor did you lie. But you escaped from them.”  Adithya Karikalan saw Azhwarkkadian only at that time. “Who is this? His face looks familiar to me.”  “Yes, Your Highness. You have seen me a few years ago.”  “Even your voice is familiar.”  “Yes, Prince. You heard my voice at an important moment three years ago.”  A black shadow spread across the face of the Crown Prince. “Important moment … .. … Three years back... What was that... Did I hear this  \\x0cvoice when I was searching for the enemy in an island of the Vaigai River?”  “Yes, Your Highness. That voice was mine. It was I who told you about the enemy’s hiding place. I was hiding behind a tree when I spoke to you.”  “What a horrible day it was! I was in a state of murderous frenzy. Even now if I think of that day, my body shivers. Vaishnavite, why were you hiding in the forest on that day? Why didn’t you appear before me at that time?”  “Your Highness just spoke about your murderous frenzy. You were killing everyone who came on your way. And I wanted to live for some more time.”  “Is that the only reason? I shouted several times requesting the disembodied voice to manifest before me. Even then you did not come.”  “Because I did not want to earn the fury of my adopted sister who is at present the Queen of Pazhuvur.”  “And you wanted me to earn her fury, right? Villain!”  Karikalan unsheathed his sword. Vandhiya Thevan was afraid. He was sure that Azhwarkkadian would be killed. He told the Crown Prince in a very soft voice. “Your Highness, this man has come from the Chief Minister. He has got a message for you. Please get your message before punishing him.”  \\x0c“What’s the use in punishing him? What’s the use in punishing anybody for that matter?”  Karikalan put back the sword in its sheath. Unlike Vandhiya Thevan, Azhwarkkadian was unfazed by Karikalan’s anger. He spoke to him with a strange smile on his face. “Your Highness, I know you’ll direct your anger towards me. That was why I avoided meeting you till now. My sister too is still angry with me. She refuses to see me now. But I now learn that she is no longer angry with you. You came to the feast at Kadambur Palace only after seeing her letter. Am I right, Your Highness?”  “Scoundrel! Wicked Vaishnava! How the hell do you know?”  “I work for the Chief Minister. Nothing can happen in the Chozha Empire without his knowledge.”  “One day or other I’ll banish Anbil Aniruddha Brahmarayar and you from the Chozha Kingdom. Now you two mount on your horses. And ride on either side of me. Let’s talk as we go. “  \\x0cChapter 13 - The Secret in Manimekalai’s Heart  Nandini was reclining on a bed made of the softest feathers. She was in the specially decorated chamber at the Kadambur Palace. Nandini was draped in luxurious silks. She wore the finest jewels. The beauty on her face was well beyond the reach of any known language. Her eyes were half-closed. She was indulging in her most favourite pastime - day-dreaming. Whenever her eyes opened fully, rays of lightning flashed from her large, beautiful eyes. On the surface it appeared if she was dozing; but her mind was hyper-active. If somebody looked deep into her half-closed eyes they would find that they focused on the source of incense smoke. A mud pot was holding the incense powder. Perfumed smoke came out of the pot and went up in circles and then vanished into thin air. Nobody knew what Nandini saw in the weird shapes caused by the smoke. She let out a long sigh. Her pearly lips murmured:  “All my dreams have evaporated like the smoky incense circles. The smoke at least leaves a pleasant smell behind. My dreams will leave behind nothing but pain, grief, humiliation and disgrace.”  “Devi, Devi... May I come in?”  Nandini heard the soft voice of Manimekalai. “Please come. Why should you ask my permission to enter a room in your own Palace?”  Manimekalai gently opened the door and walked in. It was true that she just walked. But with her face glowing with zeal and enthusiasm in her steps and in the movement of her hands, it appeared as if she was dancing her way into the room. Nandini sat up. She pointed out to the ivory seat near her bed to Manimekalai. Manimekalai sat down. “Devi, my brother has taught me how I should behave in your presence. He has spoken a lot about the culture of the Southerners. Very specifically he has told me that I should not enter anybody’s room without asking their permission first.”  “Let the Southerners and their culture go to hell. Forget whatever your brother has taught you. And yes, don’t call me Devi or Queen. Never! Call me, Akka.”  “Akka! Akka! Sounds very sweet! I hope you won’t mind my disturbing you here quite often.”  “Yes, it’ll be a disturbance if you come every now and then. Instead if you opt to stay here, there won’t be any disturbance at all.”  \\x0cNandini’s smile was quite seductive. Manimekalai was bowled over by that smile. For a while she was staring at Nandini’s beautiful face. “I have never seen somebody half as beautiful as you, Akka. Not even in paintings.”  “Oh My God! Please don’t fall in love with me. Already the whole town is calling me a “Mayamohini” meaning the seducing witch. Any man who comes near me falls for me. That’s the charge against me. I don’t want you to add to my charges.”  “Akka, if only I hear somebody talking like that I’ll cut off their tongues.”  “There’s no point in blaming the whole town, Manimekalai. See I am married to an old man. That makes their tongues wag.”  Manimekalai’s face fell. “Yes, Akka. I and my brother feel sorry about it. But that can never give anybody any right to talk ill of you.”  “Let them talk, Manimekalai. Even our Holy Mother Seetha Devi was not spared from such gossip. But that’s not a loss to Seetha Devi. Ok, let’s not worry about my problems. Now tell me about you.”  \\x0c“What’s there to tell, Akka?”  “Cheat! Didn’t you tell me in the evening that you’d reveal what’s in your heart?”  Nandini gently spanked Manimekalai’s cheeks. “Akka, I want to be with you for all my life. If they organise a Swayamvar for me and give me the liberty to choose my life-partner and if women are allowed to marry women, then I’ll garland you as my husband, Akka.”  “Not even a whole day has passed since we met. And you have already started to talk like this. Well… I am happy in a way. I was longing for a dear friend like you for many, many years. The daughter’s of the Chieftains of Chozha Kingdom favour that devil in Pazhaiyaarai. I’ve at least got you. But whatever you said a short while ago can’t happen at all. A woman marrying a woman has never happened in this world. You’ll have to marry a man. You have no other option.”  “What if I remain a virgin all my life, Akka?”  “No, dear. The world won’t let you remain a virgin; neither your father nor your brother. They won’t rest till they marry you off to some man. Tell me who you want to marry, given a choice.”  “Please give me some names, Akka. I’ll choose from them.”  \\x0c“Ok. Will you marry Prince Madhuranthakan known for his devotion to Lord Shiva? Or marry the Crown Prince Adithya Karikalan noted for his great acts of valour?”  Manimekalai appeared to have been lost in thoughts and suddenly burst out laughing. “Why are you laughing, girl? Do you think that I am making fun of you? Your brother asked me to come here particularly to settle that issue. Adithya Karikalan might come here anytime. Your brother will be coming along with him. I have given a promise to your brother that I’d tell him what’s in your heart.”  “Even I do not know what’s there in my heart, Akka. What can I do?”  “Tell me at least why you laughed.”  “As soon as you mentioned Madhuranthakan’s name, something came to my mind. Four months ago he came here. He travelled in the closed palanquin in which you usually travel. We at the ladies’ chambers did not know this secret switch-over arrangement. We thought you had come in that palanquin. “Why hasn’t the Pazhuvur Queen visited the ladies’ chambers yet?” - we were asking one another. Akka, didn’t you say a little while ago that a woman cannot marry another woman? My marrying Madhuranthakan would be a woman marrying a woman.”  Nandini smiled. “Yes, I too thought that you won’t like Madhuranthakan. I told this to your brother. Madhuranthakan is already married to my brother-in-law’s daughter. She’s a very arrogant woman. You can’t live with her even for a single day. Then it means that you have lost your heart to Prince Karikalan.”  “No, Akka. I won’t say that. I have not seen him at all. How can I lose my heart to him?”  “Dear, women born in Royal families do not have the luxury of seeing the man before losing their hearts to him. Have you not heard in stories and epics about women who have lost their hearts to men after seeing them in paintings and after hearing about their accomplishments?”  “You are right, Akka. I too have heard. I have heard that Adithya Karikalan is one of the greatest warriors of our Kingdom and that his fame has spread all over the world. Akka, is it true that he cut off Veerapandiyan’s head in a single stroke?”  Manimekalai failed to notice the terrifying change of expression on Nandini’s face. Nandini looked away for a few seconds and then turned over to Manimekalai. By that time her face had resumed its usual seductive charm. “Manimekalai, do you think that beheading a person in a single stroke is an act of valour? Isn’t that a terribly gruesome act?”  “I don’t understand, Akka. Is it not valour to cut the head of the enemy? How can it be gruesome?”  \\x0c“Imagine a situation like this. Somebody is dear to you. His enemy has come to kill him. Think of your brother. Or, of the person, your beloved whom you want to marry. And think of that person lying in bed. At that time somebody comes with a drawn sword to kill him. Will you praise the valour of the aggressor?”  Manimekalai thought for a while. “A strange question, Akka. Allow me to explain what appears in my little brain. If I am in that kind of a situation I won’t be a silent spectator, Akka. I’ll grab the sword from the hands of the killer and kill him with his sword.”  Nandini hugged Manimekalai. “A very apt reply, my dear. I should now make sure that such an intelligent woman like you should get the right husband. I doubt even Adithya Karikalan will be a right match to you, my dear.”  “I think so too, Akka. After knowing about Karikalan, I am only afraid of him. Can I tell you what’s there in my heart?”  \\x0cChapter 14 - Will Her Dream Come True? Nandini held Manimekalai’s chin and lifted her face. She tried to look into her eyes which had blossomed fully in happiness. “Dear, its better that you do not open up your heart to me. We have hardly met. Not even a whole day has passed since we came to know each other. You should reveal what’s in your heart only to your old friends and not to strangers like me.”  “No, Akka. For me it seems that I have known you for ages. My heart is keen on sharing those things with you which I have not shared with anybody else. I feel I am now bold enough to seek favours from you which I have not sought from anyone.”  “Then go ahead, my dear. Ask whatever you want.”  “I have read about the concept of “apparition” in stories. Can it happen in real life? When somebody is not physically before us can we feel the person’s presence?”  “It happens at times. If our love for someone is so intense we can feel the person’s presence even though he may not be there. Paradoxically that happens even if our hatred for a person is intense. Haven’t you heard of Lord Krishna’s stories? You might have watched the plays as well. Kamsa hated Krishna. And he could see Krishna everywhere. He used to throw knives at the apparitions he saw and was disappointed every time. A milkmaid by name Nappinnai loved Krishna. She used to see him everywhere. She would see the Lord in the pillars,  \\x0cin the trees and even in the river. She would madly want to hug the Lord and would be disappointed. Now tell me Manimekalai, which Krishna seduced you like that?”  “Akka, I saw him for the first time about four months ago. Even before that, my brother used to speak about him. I never saw him at that time. But after seeing him once, his form used to visit me in my dreams. Even during daytime I could see him standing before me.”  “And you saw that magician’s apparition yesterday?”  “You are right, Akka. But how did you know?”  “Didn’t anybody tell you that I have magical powers?”  “Yes, they have. But is it true, Akka?”  “You can test me. Well, I’ll use my powers of magic to tell you which handsome prince stole your heart. “  “Come on, Akka! Please! I am too shy to tell his name.”  Nandini closed her eyes for a while and then opened them again. “The man who heartlessly stole your heart hails from the Vaana clan. His full name is Vallavaraiyan Vandhiya Thevan. Am I right?”  “Oh My God! Akka, it’s true that you have powers of divination.”  “Oh My silly girl! If you have lost your heart to somebody why don’t you tell your brother about him? Why should you lure Madhuranthakan? Or drag Adithya Karikalan all the way here only to disappoint him?”  “Akka, my brother Kandhanmaran does not like him.”  “But in what way does that matter? Tell me, is your brother going to marry him? But didn’t you tell me that it was Kandhanmaran who first told you about Vandhiya Thevan? And it was your brother who brought him here.”  “Yes, you are right. It was he who first spoke about him. It was he who brought him here. But then suddenly there was a change of mind. And there’s a reason for that as well. He stabbed my brother when they were in Thanjavur. And my brother was lying sick in your palace. And it was because you took good care of him that he came back to life.”  “Your brother has this habit of exaggerating things. He was just staying in our Palace. I didn’t do much. This is not the time to discuss that. What are you going to do now? Your lover has become your brother’s avowed enemy.”  “But do you know what he says?”  \\x0c“”Who is this ‘He’ you are alluding to?”  “It’s him, Akka. Please don’t tease me. You told his name a little while ago. He swears that he never stabbed Kandhanmaran. Somebody had stabbed him and had left him bleeding near the walls of Thanjavur Fort. And then it was he who saved my brother.”  “When did he tell that to you?”  “Yesterday.”  “Did you see Vandhiya Thevan yesterday? Didn’t you say that you only saw his apparition?”  “That’s it, Akka. I am confused. I am not clear whether I saw him or his apparition. When I think back on what happened yesterday everything looks like a dream. They say if somebody dies their spirit will manifest as apparition and talk to us. Is it true, Akka?”  When Manimekalai asked this question the fear in her voice was apparent. Nandini too shuddered in fear. She was staring pointlessly at the ceiling and spoke in a distant voice. “Yes, it’s true. If someone died young their spirits would be hovering around those who are living. If they had been beheaded the head alone would appear at  \\x0ctimes. At times the headless trunk would appear. And sometimes the head and the body will come separately pestering you, ‘Have you avenged my death yet?’”  And then she spoke aloud. “Silly girl! Why do you ask that question? Do you fear that something terrible must have happened to your lover? Who planted that doubt in your mind?”  “There’s a person who deals with spirits in this palace. He’d be possessed by spirits at times and would blurt out what’s happening in the world. I sent for him. But he had been beaten up by somebody. His wife, Devaratti, came in his stead. And she told me all those things.”  “Don’t believe those stupid things.”  “No, Akka. I didn’t. If he had come as a mere spirit I could not have touched him.”  “You can neither touch a spirit nor an apparition. Why are you telling that now? Did you touch your lover yesterday?”  “That’s where I am confused, Akka. I feel that I have touched him. But now when I think of many other things I am not sure.”  \\x0c“Tell me what happened yesterday. Don’t leave anything out. I’ll clear your doubts.”  “Ok, Akka. If I jumble up things please stop me. Ask questions if you do not understand, Akka. I was here in this place yesterday almost at the same time as now. I came here to check whether your room has been properly made according the strict instructions given by my brother. I was looking at my face in this mirror.”  “Oh, you were admiring your own beauty?”  “No, Akka. I know about my face. Not worth looking at.”  “Why are you so harsh on yourself? Your face is flawless. It will make the Goddess of Love, Rathi Devi and the wife of the chief of gods, Indrani burn in jealousy.”  “But they are not worth the dirt in your feet, Akka.”  “Ok go ahead. You were looking your face in the mirror.”  “Suddenly another face appeared in the mirror. It was very close to mine.”  “Was that your lover’s face?”  \\x0c“Yes! I was shocked!”  “Why should you be shocked? Didn’t you say that you were seeing his face in your dreams quite often?”  “Yes, I did. But there was a difference. In my dreams the face used to be at a distance. Same is the case when he comes as an apparition. But here... here... it was from behind..... I feel very shy... Akka… “  “Naughty girl. Tell me exactly what happened.”  “It appeared as if the face came to kiss me on my cheeks. I turned around in shock. There was nobody there. Nor could I see the face in the mirror. I had a doubt. Do you remember the secret door from this room that leads to the Hunters’ Hall? I showed it to you. Yesterday the mirror was placed just opposite to the door. I thought somebody must have opened the door from the Hunters’ Hall and must have peeped out. I thought it was not possible. How can a stranger enter that hall? Impossible! For whatever it was worth I opened the door and went into that hall.”  Nandini was very curious now. “Was the thief hiding in the Hunters’ Hall? Was he caught?”  “Akka, why do you call him a thief?”  \\x0c“Not in a derogatory sense, dear. Didn’t he steal your heart? I was referring to that. Tell me, was he in that hall?”  “Surprise of surprises, Akka. He was not there. There was only our man Idumban Kari who was cleaning the hall. His face resembled the gory face of Kaduvetti Karuppan a statue placed outside the Ayyanar temple. ‘Was anybody else here in this hall?’ I asked him. He insisted there was nobody other than him in that hall.”  “Do you think he would have lied?”  “I don’t know, Akka. But I had a strong feeling that someone was hiding in the hall. ‘Let the culprit come out on his own’, I thought and came back to this room.”  “But did he come out?”  “Please let me continue. After I came to this room I was listening for the sound of people speaking in the Hunters’ Hall. Yes, I did hear some voices. I also heard something falling down. When I was debating what to do, this door opened. I hid the lamp and was waiting. There is a small round door within this large door. A figure was trying to enter this room through that small door. “Danger! Danger! Please save me.” I heard somebody shouting. As the voice and the figure resembled him I helped him through that small door. Then I rekindled the lamp. Yes, Akka. It was him!”  \\x0c“Manimekalai, that’s a surprise. It looks like a page from the famous Vikramadithya Stories.”  “I am not finished, Akka. When I first saw the person who had been very regular in my dreams for the past four months, my heart skipped a beat. I became ecstatic. But I feigned anger and talked to him in that tone. “How can you enter the ladies’ chambers like this?” I asked him. He told me he was being chased by somebody who wanted to kill him. “You are a coward. You are afraid to die.” I teased him. He told me that he was not armed. I accused him of back-stabbing my brother. ‘No. I never did that. I will never do that.’ He swore, Akka.”  “And you believed him?”  “At that time he appeared credible. But when I think of the subsequent developments I am not very sure, Akka.”  “What happened?”  “As I was talking to him I was also listening to the sounds coming from the Hunters’ Hall. I could hear several people walking in the hall. And I could hear many people talking too. I then thought maybe he is telling the truth. And that these people were after him. My only concern at that time was to save him from danger, Akka. I wanted to know about the persons who were intent on killing him. I even suspected Idumban Kari. He could be an accomplice to the killers. Or he could be an accomplice to this man. I wanted to know. “I was also worried that so many people know about the secret passage from the Hunters’ Hall to this room. And when I realised that you will be staying in this room I was even more worried. I did not have the courage to send word to my father. If he came to know of his presence he will be killed. So I asked him to stay here and went back to the Hunters’ Hall to see who else was there. There were five or six of them. They were all in the corner of the hall huddling close to the wall. They were shocked on seeing me. I too was afraid of them. I drove away my fears and wanted to ask about the strangers in an angry voice. By that time my friend Chandramathi came to this room looking for me. She was calling “Amma... Amma...”  “Only then I remembered that he was alone in the room. I was afraid that Chandramathi might see him and scream. I returned to this room making a mental note to go back to the Hunters Hall later in the day. By that time this man had vanished without a trace. “Did you see anybody here?” I asked my friend. She had not seen anybody. I searched for him and then unable to find him I went back to the Hunters’ Hall. Nobody whom I saw earlier was there. Idumban Kari was the only person in the hall. He was busy with his cleaning work. “What happened to those who were here sometime ago? Who were they?” I asked Idumbankari. “Nobody came here, Your Highness.” He kept on insisting. I could not believe him. My friend Chandramathi started teasing me. “Akka, something has happened to you. I think you’ve gone crazy. You are seeing people who are not there.”  Then she told me that you people have reached the gates of our Fort. And that, my father wanted me to receive you. So I left for the Palace gates. To reach the gates faster I took two flights of stairs up and reached the terrace. As I was  \\x0cwalking on the terrace I saw something strange. The warrior from the Vaana clan was walking in the back yard of the palace along the wall. I even saw him jumping the wall using a bamboo pole. Yes, that was how it appeared to my eyes. Did it really happen or did I hallucinate, I do not know.”  Nandini was lost in thoughts. The two faces she saw in the midst of the thick forest growth just outside the Palace appeared in her mind. She knew that horsemen had been sent to capture those two people. Would they have been captured by now? And if they were, would they be brought here? “What do you think, Akka?”  Manimekalai’s words broke her reverie. “Me? Are you asking me? Well, I think that you are now madly in love.”  “Are you teasing me like my friend Chandramathi?”  “No, my dear girl. I’ll be the last person to make fun of your love. It was you who saw him. Even you can’t tell whether it was real, or a dream or a hallucination. How can I tell, my dear? Is there any secret way to get out of this room?”  “As far as I know, there is none, Akka.”  \\x0c“He could have gone the same way used by you and Chandramathi.”  “There were several maids on the way. He could not have gone without their knowledge.”  “Quite surprising! Did you tell your father about this? “  “No, Akka. I didn’t. I am a little shy. I am also afraid, Akka. If he had really come here... “  “You are right. Its better you don’t tell these things to men. They won’t understand.”  “I am debating whether I should tell my brother or not.”  “If you tell him it will become a big issue. He wants you to marry Karikalan at any cost.”  “You will have to help me, Akka. Kandhanmaran is devoted to you. If you tell him he won’t refuse… Please... Akka... “  “Oh My God! You are making me work against the very purpose of my visit. You are a very smart girl. Assuming that your marriage to Karikalan is dropped we are not sure about the other person. You don’t know what’s in his mind. What’s the guarantee that he’d marry you?”  \\x0c“I am not bothered about that, Akka. Even if he doesn’t like me... “  “That’s the fate of women. Whatever men do women have to love them and even give up their lives for them. That’s the rule. Let’s see your luck. If something like what happened yesterday happens now you should tell me. Will you?”  “Who else can I tell, Akka? I had a dream yesterday. Want to share that with you.”  “In addition to day-dreaming you also dream in the night. What was that again? Did he come again in the dream to deceive you?”  “No, Akka. This is something different. And quite frightening too. They say that if you dream in the wee hours of morning it’s likely to happen. Is that true, Akka?”  “First tell me your dream. Did you dream about somebody else?”  “No, Akka. About the same man. I saw somebody was about to stab him. He was unarmed. But there was a shining sword lying on the floor. I grabbed the sword and pounced on the killer. I was about to stab the killer. Only then did I see his face. He was my brother Kandhanmaran. I screamed and woke up. I was bathed in sweat. I was shivering. Though it was a dream it seemed like real. If it comes true..... Oh My God!”  \\x0c“Oh my dear! You are really confused. Whatever was real looks like an illusion to you. Whatever was a dream looks like real to you. What a friend I have got! If I am crazy, you are crazier still.”  Chandramathi came in at that time. “They are on the way. We have got news that they have crossed the Veeranarayana Lake.”  \\x0cChapter 15 - The Royal Hospitality  The gates of the Kadambur Sambuvaraiyar Palace witnessed a miracle on that day. To the point eyes could see the place was filled with people. There were men, women, children and even aged people in that crowd. Those old men and women who could not stand on their own used the support of canes to stand near the Palace gates. . They were so anxious to see the valiant face of Adithya Karikalan that they did not mind being shoved around by the jostling crowd. The children did not mind being squeezed by the crowd. They used all their energies to move further up in the crowd and go near the gates. Young women forgot their traditional sense of shame. They did not mind being pushed and touched by strangers and were trying to move forward. Young men on the other hand did not pay heed to those young women but were keen on capturing vantage points from which they could have a better view of the visiting Royalty, the Crown Prince. Many young men had even climbed up the trees standing near and opposite to the Kadambur Palace. Others even risked climbing up the outer walls of the palace and were pushed down by the security guards. There were many young mothers balancing their infants on their hips waiting for a glimpse of the Crown Prince. To be in the midst of such a jostling crowd was an unmitigated suffering for them. Yet they were cooing to their dear ones, “Please don’t cry, dear. The greatest warrior of the Tamilnadu, the one who beheaded Veerapandiyan, the one and only Adithya Karikalan is about to pass through before our eyes. If you happen to see him once one day you may also become a warrior like him.” In the same way the lovers were pacifying their beloved, and mothers, their children. Adithya Karikalan’s fame had spread throughout the kingdom. Who would not  \\x0cbe keen to see the person who stepped into the battlefield at the age of twelve, the one who wielded the sword at such a young age and killed many an enemy, the one who crushed the Pandya forces at the Sevur battlefield and made the Pandya King Veerapandiyan flee to a desert and hide himself in a cave, the one who at his 19th year of age broke through the personal bodyguards of Veerapandiyan, found out his place of hiding and brought his head back as a war-souvenir? Of course there were several rumours concerning the Crown Prince; most of them gained strength during the last three, four years. It was rumoured that after Adithya Karikalan was designated as the Crown Prince he broke off with his father Sundara Chozhan and that the old emperor did not want him to ascend the throne after him. In the past, a Chozha Prince who had ruled over Kanchi soon started the great Pallava dynasty. According to another rumour doing rounds- the Crown Prince also wanted to start a new dynasty in Kanchi. Some said that Adithya Karikalan was put off by the special love the Emperor had for his younger son Arulmozhivarman. Others violently denied such rumours and insisted that it was rare to see such loving brothers like Karikalan and Arulmozhivarman. There were also rumours about Karikalan still remaining unmarried. It was rumoured that the Crown Prince refused to marry King’s daughters and insisted on marrying a priest’s daughter and making her his queen. And that was the reason for the stand-off between the son and the father, the rumour-mongers explained. Another set of rumours went on a different line. That the Crown Prince had lost his mind thanks to some wicked spell cast by the evil sorcerers of the Pandya Kingdom and it was precisely for that reason that the Chieftains of the Chozha Empire did not want him to succeed the Emperor. Whatever may be the rumours people were dying to see the Crown Prince. Even as the news spread that he was going to visit the Kadambur Palace it created a storm in the vicinity. When it was confirmed that the Prince was going to come to the palace that evening people from all the villages in the radius of twenty miles had assembled to see him. The words coming from thousands of mouths lost their meanings and became the meaningless roar of a sea in turbulence. The security guards had cleared the way for the Prince and his retinue near the Palace gates. As people pushed those in the front they in turn moved forward blocking the way reserved for the Prince. The guards shoved them away to clear the way. This back and forth action too resembled the waves in the ocean. Aperson standing on the top branch of a tree shouted. “They are coming!”  “Where? Where?” - A thousand voices shouted in unison. A horse came running at full speed. To avoid being trodden by the horse people moved quickly to give way. “The Sambuvaraiyar Prince” - they recognised the horse-rider. Yes, Kandhanmaran had come. He did not answer the anxious question posed to him by the people. He rode fast till the Palace gate and then dismounted. He saw Sambuvaraiyar and Pazhuvettaraiyar standing there. He bowed to them and told them almost in a whisper. “The Crown Prince is coming. But he is not in his moods. Very short tempered. I rode ahead only to caution you. Let us accord a Royal reception to him. Even if he were to utter something unpleasant let’s not mind it. Let’s not even respond to it.”  He then looked up at the terrace. He saw the women of the Royal household waiting in the terrace of the first tower. He then entered the fort and climbed up the stairs to the terrace. As soon as he reached the terrace his eyes avoided all others and sought Nandini. He went near her. “Devi, I’ve delivered on my promise. I have brought the Prince with me. There he is. But as of now he behaves like a mad elephant. I don’t know how we are going to manage him.”  “Why do you worry about that? What do you need to control a mad elephant? A goad, right? You have two, in the form of your sister’s beautiful eyes. So there is no need to worry.”  Manimekalai squealed. “Akka, what’s this?”  Kandhanmaran responded to his sister:  \\x0c“Manimekalai, there’s nothing wrong in what the Pazhuvur Queen says. One should have done penance to have somebody like Adithya Karikalan as one’s husband.”  Before Manimekalai could answer Nandini intervened. “Is somebody else coming along with the Prince?”  “Yes, Parthibendra Pallavan and Vandhiya Thevan are coming along.”  Nandini threw a pointed glance at Manimekalai and asked Kandhanmaran:  “Which Vandhiya Thevan? You said you have a friend by that name? Is that him?”  “Yes, the true friend who tried to back-stab me. He jumped from nowhere and joined us at the banks of River Vellaru. I am putting up with him only for the sake of the Prince. Otherwise I would have made him a prey to my sword.”  Manimekalai’s face fell. “Anna, if it’s true that he tried to stab you, why should we let him inside our palace?”  \\x0c“Don’t poke your nose into the men’s affairs, dear. They’ll fight with each other today; and then become thick friends tomorrow. That’s their way of life.”  Kandhanmaran smiled. “It’s not like that. I just said that I had to overlook that because of the Prince. Oh, you have got so many baskets of flowers! If you shower the flowers on the Prince his tempers will cool and he’ll be his usual cool self. See there, they have come. Let me go down to receive them.”  Kandhanmaran ran through the steps. Seen from that terrace it appeared as if there was a raging ocean of people and in a particular spot there was a swirl. And the three horsemen appeared like a boat caught in that swirl of current. The next moment they were covered by the sea of people. The ‘swirl’ travelled further and reached the gates of the palace. The three horsemen were the Crown Prince, Vandhiya Thevan and Parthibendra Pallavan. The elephants, horses and infantry were blocked by the crowd far away from the gates. Their horses stopped at the gates. The band started to play. There were twenty drums, two hundred trumpets, about three hundred thara, a percussion instrument and five hundred little drums. The sound coming from the band silenced the crowd. After a while the band stopped playing. The herald seized the opportunity, climbed up the platform and roared in a thunderous voice:  \\x0c“Manumanthatha born in the Surya clan! The great emperor Sibi born of the same clan, the man who gave his flesh to save the life of a dove, Rajakesari who was born after Sibi, His son, Parakesari, the great Manuneethi Chozhan who sacrificed his own son in order to render justice to a cow in his Kingdom, Karikal Peruvalavan who made the Tiger Flag fly high in the Himalayas, Nalankilli, Nedunkilli, Perunarkilli, Kulamutrathu Thunjia Killi Valavan, Kurappalli Thunjia Killivalavan, Koperunchozhar, who established 72 temples for Lord Shiva, the great one who came on this line of Kings who bore ninety and six wounds on his body, Pazhaiyaarai Vijayaalaya Chozhan, His son, the one who established 82 temples for Lord Shiva on the banks of River Cauvery from Sasya Hills to the city of Poompuhar, His son, the one who vanquished Madurai and Lanka and the one who build the Golden Hall at Thillai Chidambaram Temple, Emperor Paranthaka Chozha, His son, the One who defeated the forces of the Kannara Thevan of the Twin Provinces, and the one who died in Aatroor, the valiant Arinjaya Chozhan, His son, the who has brought the region from Lanka to Cheetpuli Country under one rule, Emperor Pazhaiyaarai Paranthaka Sundara Chozhan, His first born, the Crown Prince, the Head of the Armed Forces of the Kingdom In the North, the one who beheaded Veerapandiyan, Adithya Karikalan comes here! Parak! Parak!”  When the person finished heralding the visit of the Crown Prince it appeared as if the rains had just stopped. Another herald standing near him now started:  “The King of Kolli Hills, the man who by a single arrow could kill a lion, a bear, a deer, a boar - The warrior Valvil Ori - the One who was born in his clan, the King of Kings, the Warrior of Warriors, the Brave and Majestic - Sambuvaraiyar - the one who is an eternal friend to the Chozha Emperor, the One who guards the Veeranarayana Lake - the one who heads five-thousand strong army, the Sambuvaraiyar begs of the Crown Prince Adithya Karikalan, with all his heart and soul that He be pleased to visit his small palace and grace Him! May the visit of the Chozha Prince bring auspiciousness to all!”  \\x0cOnce the heralding was over the women in the terrace showered flowers on the visitors. Adithya Karikalan and Vandhiya Thevan looked up. There amongst many beautiful faces Vandhiya Thevan could only see the fully blossomed face of Manimekalai. Forgetting himself he smiled at her. Only then he realised his mistake and turned around to look at the other side. Adithya Karikalan’s face now showed greater signs of irritation. He jumped off from the horse. The other two also dismounted. The band started playing again. The people who remained silent till then started shouting. The guests and hosts entered the Fort. The gates were then closed with a big noise. The sound of the gates closing distracted the Crown Prince. “Why should they close the doors in such a hurry? Are they planning to imprison me inside this Fort, as they have imprisoned my father in Thanjavur? What will happen to my retinue?”  The two old men - Sambuvaraiyar and Pazhuvettaraiyar - were stunned. Pazhuvettaraiyar managed a smile and spoke to him in a sweet voice. “Prince, your father and you are forever imprisoned in the loving hearts of the millions of people of this Kingdom. How can anyone imprison you otherwise?”  Sambuvaraiyar added:  \\x0c“Prince, if all those who have come to see you enter this palace what will happen? Even when they were standing outside the orchards and gardens around the Palace have gone waste as if run over by an army of unruly monkeys. Once the people go away we will safely bring in your retinue to the Palace. Till such time we have organized an army of men to take care of your personal needs, Prince.”  By that time the noise made by the people outside the Fort increased. Karikalan asked Kandhanmaran, “Show me the way to the terrace.”  Kandhanmaran pointed out to the stairs. Karikalan almost ran to them. Kandhanmaran, Parthibendra Pallavan and Vandhiya Thevan ran behind him. Sambuvaraiyar could not hold himself any longer. “What’s this? I think we have unnecessarily brought in a terrible nuisance. I don’t think he is of the right mind. We have listened to youngsters and have invited disaster on ourselves.”  “Don’t worry. Nothing will happen. Either our plans will succeed. Or will not. Who bothers?” - Pazhuvettaraiyar was calm and collected. “I am not concerned about our plans. If something happens when he stays here then I’ll be in trouble. The omens and signs are not good. And the Crown Prince looks like a mad elephant. Did you see the irritation on his face? And the stinging poison in his words?”  \\x0c“Yes, I did. I guess we may have to grin and bear it for a few days. That Parthibendra Pallavan will help us rein him in. There’s another young man who has come along. I hate him. I have a doubt that he is a spy. He was there when we first had our meeting here. He was the one hiding behind the tree yesterday evening.”  “Oh, he is my son’s friend. Let’s not worry about him. Why are they running to the ladies’ side? Should we also go?”  By this time Parthibendra Pallavan who had gone with the other two till the stairs had come back. He came near the two old men. He could hear the last words spoken by Sambuvaraiyar. “Your Highness can doubt the Crown Prince in any other department. But not regarding women. He never looks at women.”  “Then how will our plan work?” Pazhuvettaraiyar asked him. “Well that depends on Sambuvaraiyar’s luck and the Chozha Empire’s luck.”  “Parthibendra, let’s forget Manimekalai’s luck. Why should the Prince come with this kind of an irritation? Why should he talk in that venomous tone? My only prayer to you is that somehow you should take him back from here without any incident.”  \\x0c“Till we reached the banks of River Vellaru, the Prince was cheerful and cordial. And then this Vandhiya Thevan and another Vaishnavite came in. They must have told him something. From then on the Prince’s face has become like this.”  “We thought so. Now tell me what can we do now? That trouble-maker young man has also come with you... “  “Be a little more patient. I’ll take care of everything. I have a score to settle with that young man. I am looking for the right time.”  When Karikalan and the two men reached the terrace the women were coming down the steps. Karikalan spoke to Kandhanmaran. “Friend, how can you make these mothers wait for us? It’s not right. We should go to their place to pay our respects to them.”  He kept his hands folded and let the women pass on the stairs. As every woman walked past him he asked Kandhanmaran about her. When it was Nandini’s turn Karikalan explained, “Oh it’s my little grandmother from Pazhuvur! Oh, has she really come? I am very happy.”  Nandini did not respond. But only glanced daggers at him with here sharp eyes. Karikalan’s body shuddered due to the intensity of her glance. The next minute Karikalan gathered himself and started teasing Manimekalai who was tagging  \\x0calong. “Oh, this must be your sister Manimekalai. She looks like a painting of a celestial woman. We should find a proper groom for her.”  Manimekalai’s cheeks became red. There were dimples in her cheeks. She saw Vandhiya Thevan through the corner of her eyes and started climbing down the stairs pretty fast. After all the women had left the place Karikalan climbed up the terrace. The people who had just started to disburse became excited and started hailing him. They started coming back to the gates of the Fort. Karikalan saw the herald standing alone in a raised platform very close to the terrace. He signalled him to come near him. When he did he ordered him to make some announcements to the people on his behalf. The herald went back to his place and beat his drums. He repeated some of the achievements of Karikalan and then spoke in a loud voice:  “And that Prince Adithya Karikalan will stay in this Kadambur Palace for a week or ten days. He will be visiting the surrounding villages as well. He will be meeting the people and would receive petitions from them.”  That did it. Whatever the noise the crowd had been making hitherto appeared relatively as perfect silence. The noise reached the sky. The sound of people  \\x0capplauding their prince, hailing him and the sheer excitement in their voice rose up in the air and spread to the vicinity even submerging the sound of water going through the seventy four canals of the Veeranarayanapuram Lake. Sambuvaraiyar, Pazhuvettaraiyar and Parthibendra Pallavan were standing in the same place. Karikalan came back from the terrace and went near them. He talked to Parthibendran:  “What happened to you Parthibendra? Why are you stuck up here? By any chance have you too started to conspire with these old men?”  The old men were shocked. They saw the handsome face of the Prince. He was now sporting an innocent smile. Sambuvaraiyar gathered himself to speak:  “My Lord, you told a little while ago that you were imprisoned here. Now you are talking about conspiracy. I swear, My Lord, that during your stay here in my hut you will be absolutely safe and nothing will happen to you. And if it did my life would have left my body before that.”  “Do you think I am afraid of the danger that might happen here? Even while I was in the midst of hundred thousand enemies in the Pandya Kingdom I never thought about my safety nor did I worry about my life. Then why should I fear when I am in the midst of my close friends? But please do not call this palace a hut. Oh My God! How tall are the walls! How strong! The walls are bigger than those in Thanjavur Fort. Tell me this, what kind of enemies did you have in mind before designing such strong walls?”  \\x0c“Prince, we do not have any enemies. Anybody who is an enemy to the Chozha Kingdom is our enemy. Anybody who is a friend to the Chozhas is our friend.”  “Your words make me very happy. I request you to share them with your son Kandhanmaran. For he sees my friend the Prince of Vaana clan Vandhiya Thevan as his enemy. Is that not a great blunder?”  Kandhanmaran hung down his head. Chapter 16 - Malaiyaman’s Worry  There was a huge yard in the Sambuvaraiyar Palace between the Palace and the compound wall. While Kandhanmaran was leading the way Karikalan walked behind him looking around quite often. The other four men followed him. They reached the place where a podium and a shamiana had been erected for Kuravai Koothu. “Oh, God! What is this? What’s going to happen here?” - Karikalan asked. “My Lord, if you so desire, we plan to have Kuravai Koothu here.”  “Very good. You can have Kuravai Koothu. You can have Villupattu as well. You can enact plays depicting the lives of Karikal Valavan and Vijayaalaya Chozhan. We’ll spend our mornings in the forest hunting wild animals. We’ll spend the nights in singing, dancing and drama. Sambuvaraiyar, do you know what my grandfather Malaiyaman told me? ‘Don’t sleep in the night,’ he cautioned me. I told him - “Grandfather, I don’t sleep in the day. Nor do I sleep in the night. It has been three full years since I have had a good sleep. So you need not fear that my enemies will kill me while I am sleeping. Yes, they can harm me while I am awake. But there is no man in this world bold enough to do that.” This is how I consoled my grandfather. Karikalan then started laughing loudly. Sambuvaraiyar’s voice trembled in anger. “My Lord, whether you sleep or remain awake, so long as you are here in this palace no one can harm you.”  “Yes, Yes. Who the hell can hurt me in this Sambuvaraiyar’s Palace? Can anybody cross these high walls and enter the palace? Even the Lord of Death cannot come. The Lord of Death is afraid of Kadambur Sambuvaraiyar. I just shared the baseless fears of the old man from Thirukkovilur, my grandfather, I mean. See, he has become very old. Some men tend to lose their courage with the onset of old age. Now take a look at my Pazhuvur Grandfather. How majestic is his walk! Can anyone say that he has crossed sixty years of age?”  Karikalan smiled. Pazhuvettaraiyar badly wanted to give a retort. He cleared his throat. The noise resembled the roar of a lion. “See, when the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar clears his throat the whole world trembles in fear. Kandhamara, Vandhiya Theva, Parthibendra! Just think! Will you be half as strong as him at his age? Perhaps you may clear your throats like he does. But you will never bring a new girl to your harem at his age. “Thatha! It appears that you have brought your Junior Queen along with you. I saw her in the terrace. Tell me this, Thatha. How did she travel? In a closed palanquin? Or in an open chariot? Or in a cart?”  Pazhuvettaraiyar could not hold himself any longer. “I brought her along on the top of the elephant. I wanted the whole world to know.”  “That’s the way, Thatha! Let her travel in the same way hereafter. Don’t bring her in a closed palanquin. That gives rise to many juicy rumours. Just listen to this. At times my uncle Madhuranthakan uses the Junior Queen’s closed Palanquin to go places. That rumour has spread throughout the country.”  Karikalan’s laugh resembled the sound of a thunder. Nobody else laughed. Everyone was concerned in his own way. Vandhiya Thevan bit his tongue. ‘Oh My God! I have done the greatest blunder of my life! I have disclosed everything to this crazy man. Looks like he is going to share everything with these people.’ Vandhiya Thevan was worried. The Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s mind was like a volcano about to erupt. There was fire and smoke. And before the fire and lava escaped out of the volcano it boiled inside creating a roaring sound when he cleared his throat. Before he could talk, Parthibendran came forward. “My Lord! It has been only for a short time that I know the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur. But within that short time I came to know how devoted a woman she is. She is like a goddess when it comes to chastity, my Lord. If anybody ventures to comment on her I’ll make that man a victim to my sword. This is a promise,  \\x0cmy Lord.”  Kandhanmaran came forward next. “I need not have to draw a sword. Anybody who talks ill of the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur will be killed by my bare hands. That’s a promise, my Lord.”  Vandhiya Thevan was not to be left behind. “Same is the case with me. If anybody talks ill of the Pazhuvur Queen I’ll kill him with my mere looks.”  “Aha! Wait, my dear friends. Looks like you’ll even pick up a fight with me. Thatha, did you see, how these people are anxious to protect the good name of the Tamil woman. But let me make myself clear. Nobody has spoken ill of the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur. And if anybody did I won’t keep quiet. I won’t even wait till these warriors come to finish off the person. People are not talking ill of the Pazhuvur Queen but only of her closed palanquin. That coward Madhuranthakan uses it to go from one town to another. He uses it for his secret trips. When a man uses that closed palanquin covering the sides with screens and the Queen too travels in the same way it might give rise to a scandal.”  “My Lord, why should the grandson of Emperor Paranthaka and the son of Kandaraathithar, Madhuranthakan travel in a closed palanquin? I don’t understand.” - Parthibendra Pallavan said. “The reasons are funny. Madhuranthakan goes to every town in Tamilnadu in that palanquin and is gathering support for his side.”  “Why?”  “Why? To ascend the great Chozha throne after my father. Isn’t it funny? A few months ago he visited this same Kadambur Palace in a closed palanquin. There was a meeting of conspirators at mid-night. Parthibendra, the old man of Thirukkovilur, told me all these things only in your presence. Madhuranthakan is now anxious to become the Chozha King at the earliest. My grandfather is even afraid that in his anxiety he might even pack off my father to the other world earlier than his time. Don’t you remember all those things?”  “Yes, Prince. I do remember. I never believed those things even when he told them. Nor do I believe them now. Its better that you visit Thanjavur and see your father. Then.... “  “Not only you, but even I didn’t believe it. Otherwise do you think I’d have come as a guest to Kadambur Palace?”  Karikalan thought about something and laughed. Kadambur Sambuvaraiyar cleared his throat and spoke. “My Lord, you know very well about the enmity between our clan and that of Thirukkovilur Malaiyaman.”  \\x0c“I know. The Sangam Poets have composed songs on that enmity. Malaiyaman Thirumudikkari killed Valvil Ori of Kolli Hills in a war. You all belong to the Valvil Ori clan. So you are not in good terms with Thirukkovilur.”  “My Lord, Valvil Ori’s death was avenged immediately thereafter. Adhiyaman Nedumananchi, a close relative of Valvil Ori, invaded Thirukkovilur and destroyed that town. He also razed the Mullur Hill Fort of Malaiyaman to the ground.”  “Sambuvaraiyar, Adhiyaman did not do that all by himself. He sought the help of our ancestor Chozhan Killi Valavan. He could vanquish Malaiyaman only with his help. But what’s the need to dig up those old stories?”  “We have been trying to forget the past; but Malaiyaman never lets us to. He has been accusing us of something or the other.”  “Didn’t I tell you? Malaiyaman has become old. And hence has become senile. I am now concerned that he should not come with a huge army while I am here. He is too worried about my safety here.”  “Prince, if you have any doubt... “  Sambuvaraiyar was lost for words. “Doubt? No way. Our relationship with Malaiyaman has been for only two  \\x0cgenerations. But our relationship with the Pazhuvettaraiyars has been for six generations. Pazhuvur King is here with us. Am I that crazy to think that he’ll do anything against the Chozha clan?”  Karikalan’s laugh was that of a mad man. Pazhuvettaraiyar spoke in a majestic voice. “Prince, I won’t do anything against the Chozha clan. That’s a promise. I won’t do anything against fairness and justice. My second promise is two times stronger than the first. . ”  “Yes, there is something called justice and fairness. I’ve come to discuss that with you. If we have some time left after hunting and drama we’ll discuss fairness and justice. Sambuvaraiyar, have you got the rooms ready for me and my friends in this great palace?”  “Your Highness, I’ve made the entire Guest Chambers in the back row ready for you and the Pazhuvettaraiyars. I’ll make the other chieftains stay in the front rooms.”  “Oh more chieftains are going to come?”  “Yes, Prince. All the Chieftains in the vicinity want to see you.”  \\x0c“Let them come. Good. Let’s us sit down and discuss. And decide. Let’s try to come to a decision. Let Madhuranthakan’s conspiracy be there. I plan to have a conspiracy with you all. There is no place more ideal for that than this Palace.”  \\x0cChapter 17 - Poonkuzhali’s Heart  Poonkuzhali’s small boat was gliding through the waters of the canal that went all the way from Nagapattinam to Kodikkarai. Chendan Amudhan was on board with her. The boat was nearing Kodikkarai. The banks of the canal strongly smelled of golden hued screw pine flowers that had just blossomed. A parrot alighted on a screw pine flower. The flower could not bear the weight of the bird and it swayed. The parrot too swayed along with the flower and then plucked the petals with its pearly nose. As soon as the boat came near the parrot screeched and flew away. “If there’s another birth I want to be born as a parrot.” - Poonkuzhali. “That’s your thinking, Poonkuzhali. But we do not know about its pains, its problems and its sorrows.” - Chendan Amudhan. “Whatever may be its problems it can fly in the boundless sky anytime it wants. What can give greater happiness than the freedom to fly in the high skies?”  “But some people cage these parrots!”  “Yes, they do. The princesses living in the palaces keep the parrots in cages. Heartless devils. They cage the parrots and then play with them. If only I were a maid in any of these palaces I’ll give poison to the caged parrots and kill them  \\x0call. And then I’ll feed poison to the princesses and kill them as well.”  “If somebody hears your words you’ll also be branded as a heartless devil.”  “Let them. I’d rather be a devil than a princess.”  “Why do you hate the princesses, Poonkuzhali? In a way they too deserve our sympathy. Their fate is no different from those caged parrots. They are caged within their palaces and spend their whole lives there. And if only they had to step out of their palaces... Oh My God! How many security restrictions! How many protocols! What kind of care they would have to take! What kind of secrecy they’d have to maintain! Oh My God! Do you think they can row their boats like you do across the sea and along the canals of the country? Do you think they can freely roam in the forest like a deer as you do?”  “Who asked them to be caged? I never said that. If they wish they can also roam in the forests.”  “If only wishes were horses… Poonkuzhali. It depends on their birth and the way they have been brought up. You want to fly in the sky like a parrot. But that’s impossible. You were born on the shores of a sea. That has given you so much of freedom. If you had been born in a palace you won’t be free. Listen; there is another paradox. If the caged parrots get used to the princesses and the royal food they won’t fly away even if their cages are thrown open. They will fly for a while and then return to their princesses with their usual screeching sound. I have seen this happening in the palaces in Thanjavur and Pazhaiyaarai.”  “I’ll never let myself be caged like that. If only I were a parrot and if only I were  \\x0ccaged by a Princess then I’ll bite the hand of the princess which comes to feed me.”  “So you will neither be a caged parrot nor a princess caged in her own palace.”  “No. I’d rather take poison and die.”  “That’s good. In that case you should not desire to marry a Prince living in a Palace.”  The clouds were gathering in the east. There were flashes of lightning. The rumbling of the thunder was heard at a distance. When Chendan Amudhan spoke those words there were flashes of lightning coming from Poonkuzhali’s bright eyes. “Who told you that I want to marry a Prince?”  “Nobody told me. I just guessed. If you do not have that kind of a desire then it’s good. Forget whatever I said.”  For a while silence reigned over the moving boat. Chendan Amudhan was pushing the oars. Added to that was the sound of the frogs. And the distant rumbling of thunder and the sound of waves coming from a distant sea. Chendan Amudhan cleared his throat. He gathered his courage before speaking  \\x0cout his mind. “Poonkuzhali, didn’t you say that Vandhiya Thevan told you about the desire in my heart? It’ll be better if I get an answer from you at least now. There I could see the lighthouse of Kodikkarai. I may not get another chance to talk to you in private. I may have to leave for Thanjavur tomorrow. My mother has been alone there for quite some time.”  “Why should Vandhiya Thevan act as your messenger? What happened to your mouth? Why don’t you tell me directly what’s there in your heart?”  “Ok, have your way. Will you marry me?”  “Why do you ask this question?”  “Because I love you.”  “Should love always end in a marriage?”  “Not necessary. But that has been the practice in this world from time immemorial.”  “What will you give me if I marry you? Can you give me the royal life I deserve? Can you give me dresses, jewels, elephants, horses, palanquins and maids?”  \\x0c“Of course, I cannot. But I will give you a peaceful life which is more precious than all those regal paraphernalia. Listen, Poonkuzhali. My hut is in a beautiful garden in Thanjavur. I and my mother live there. If you come there your whole life will change. My mother will look after you like her own daughter. We’ll get up at dawn and pluck the flowers that would have blossomed in the creepers, plants and trees surrounding the house. We’ll make them into beautiful garlands. Then I’ll go to Thanjavur Thanikulathar Temple and Durga Parameswari Temple to give those garlands. By that time you can have a bath in the lotus pond in our garden and help my mother in her daily chores. In the evenings we can draw water from the pond to water the garden. In the evening I’ll teach you Tamil songs that are sweeter than the elixir of the celestial world. And if you sing them with your sweet voice, you’ll feel the sweetness in your tongue. And I’ll feel the sweetness in my ears. If you like we can visit a few temples in the evening. We can sing those songs in those temples too. The devotees who visit the temple will also be happy. Tell me Poonkuzhali, can there be a life sweeter than this? Happier than this? Think it over, Poonkuzhali.”  Poonkuzhali laughed out aloud. “Amudha, you described the life which you consider happy. But do you know what kind of life I want? I want to go to the celestial world and marry the chief of gods, the Devendra himself. I’ll ride with him in his vehicle, the white elephant whose name is Iravatham. We’ll ride through the clouds of the celestial world. I’ll grab the Vajrayutha, Devendra’s weapon, and use it over the clouds gathered there. When the clouds are hit by that weapon a million flashes of lightning will be seen on earth. I want to see the sky being rent by those flashes of lightning. Now if the lightning and thunder strikes the earth it falls on some distant sea. I won’t waste the thunders. I’ll see to it that the palaces in which the Princes and Princesses live are directly hit by the lightning and thunder. I will be laughing when I see those palaces crumbling to the ground. If Devendra does not want to marry me I’ll approach the Wind God. Even if he  \\x0chas many wives already I won’t mind becoming his wife. And then there will be nothing but disaster. There will be storms, cyclones, hurricanes and whirlwinds on earth all the time. Giant trees will be uprooted by the force of wind and will fall over palaces and mansions destroying them completely. I’ll unleash cyclones and storms on the ships on high seas and break them into pieces. The passengers in those ships will be on high seas and will be struggling for their lives. If there are princes and princesses among those passengers I’ll make them drown to the depths of the sea. I’ll have mercy on other passengers and save them. And if the Wind God refuses to marry me I’ll approach the God of Fire. Then this whole world will be on fire.”  “Stop, Poonkuzhali. Stop that nonsense. The bitterness in your mind makes you utter those terrible things. You have not thought over what you have spoken. It’s a great blunder that I proposed to you now without knowing your state of mind. Please forgive me. I will pray to God night and day to remove the bitterness in your heart and give you peace of mind. Poonkuzhali suddenly stood up. She looked pointedly at a tree on the banks of the canal. Chendan Amudhan also looked in the same direction. A woman’s face was seen between the branches. Chendan Amudhan was stunned for a moment because he could see a strong resemblance to his mother’s face. Then he found out it was not his mother. He guessed that it must be his aunt - his mother’s sister. He remembered Poonkuzhali saying that the lady lived in the Ghost Island near Lanka. Poonkuzhali jumped from the boat and ran towards the woman. Chapter 18 - The Arrow  Poonkuzhali saw the Mute Queen hiding behind a tree on the banks of the canal. Poonkuzhali was a little shocked because she never expected to see the lady near Kodikkarai. She knew very well that the Mute Queen detested meeting strangers. ‘Oh My God, Chendan Amudhan is with me! Will my aunt run away on seeing him?’  Poonkuzhali saw her aunt running. She jumped off from the boat. She climbed up the banks and looked around. She saw her aunt disappearing in the dense forest. Chendan Amudhan jumped off the boat and ran up to Poonkuzhali. “Poonkuzhali! Who was that?”  “Can’t you recognise her, Amudha?”  “I am not very sure. Perhaps... “  “Yes, she is my aunt. My father’s sister. Your mother’s elder sister. The one you thought had died long ago.”  \\x0c“Yes, she resembles my mother.”  “Don’t talk rubbish. There is absolutely no similarity between the two women. Even their qualities are not similar. One is a dumb cow bound to a pole in a house while the other is a queen amongst lions which roams freely in the forests.”  “That’s ok. But tell me why did the Lion-Queen run away on seeing you?”  Poonkuzhali laughed  “She ran away on seeing you. She hates strangers.”  “But I am not a stranger.”  “Aunt does not know that yet. If she did she would not have run away. But she’ll be reluctant to make your acquaintance.”  “What are you going to do now Poonkuzhali?”  “I am going to look out for her.”  “Can I come along?”  \\x0c“Why?”  “Just to see my mother’s sister and get to know her.”  “Why should you know her?”  Chendan Amudhan knew something about the Mute Queen’s life. He was curious to meet her. Who knows, perhaps she might help to change Poonkuzhali’s mind.’  “There are a hundred reasons. But tell me should there be a reason to get to know one’s own mother’s sister?”  Poonkuzhali thought for a while. “Ok, come with me. If we go together it’ll be an ordeal to locate her. But I won’t rest till I meet her. Let’s tie the boat here and go.”  Poonkuzhali secured the boat beneath a dense screw pine bush. Then the two went towards the dense forest of Kodikkarai. “Poonkuzhali I remember your saying that she is somewhere in the Ghost Island.”  \\x0c“She’ll alternate between Lanka and the Ghost Island.”  “Does she come here often?”  “No. She comes very rarely. If I don’t see her for a long time she’d come here to see me.”  “Has she come to see you now?”  “Looks like she has come on some other work.”  “What work?”  “Perhaps she has come to know the fate of her foster son, Ponniyin Selvan. She might probably be anxious to know whether he is alive or he has drowned in the sea. She should have known about the storm that hit the sea after the Prince’s ship left the shores.”  “Prince Arulmozhivarman is her foster son? Then who is her own son?”  “I don’t know. But I am not going to stop till I find out.”  \\x0c“Is her own son alive or dead?”  “Who knows? He might probably be dead.”  They remained silent for some time. Then Poonkuzhali asked him -  “Amudha, you saw your aunt. You said that she resembles your mother. Tell me whether her face reminds you of somebody else.”  “There’s a vague resemblance. I am not very sure. Looks like the whole thing is shrouded in mystery.”  “Do you see the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur quite often?”  “Once in a while, Yes. Now I remember. She has a striking resemblance to Nandini Devi. It’s surprising. How is that possible, Poonkuzhali? And how did you find it out?”  “I have been seeing my aunt for years. And I saw the Pazhuvur Queen here in Kodikkarai only a few days ago. The moment I saw her I recognised the strong resemblance between the faces of the two women.”  “What could possibly be the reason?”  \\x0c“I am going to find out. I am going to ask her today.”  “But your Aunt can’t speak. How will she answer your question?”  “How do you speak to your mother, Amudha?”  “By sign language. I have been doing it since I was born. Even then to broach a new subject will be extremely difficult.”  “I too talk to my aunt in sign language. What cannot be communicated by signs we communicate by drawing pictures.”  “It’s a pity that the two sisters of a family are dumb. I think of their parents. Poor souls! They must have felt miserable.”  “Not only that, Amudha. When they were young the sisters used to fight a lot. That was the reason grandfather took the elder sister to the Ghost Island and settled her there. She was our grandfather’s pet child. When she was born an astrologer predicted that she would become a queen one day. Grandfather was excited. But later when he learnt that she was dumb he was devastated.”  They had entered the forest. They could not locate the Mute Queen. “Amudha, we could not find her because of you. She thinks you as a stranger and is trying to hide herself.”  \\x0c“Ok, I am not lucky. Whatever I plan never happens. Can I go now?”  “How will you go, Amudha? I’ll have to guide you out of the forest.”  They heard a strange voice from the forest. That was neither a human voice nor that of an animal. The voice was heard two, three times. A few deer ran towards the direction of the voice. Poonkuzhali thought for a while. “Amudha follow me without making any noise.”  They started walking towards the direction of the voice. They saw a strange scene there. The mute queen was leaning against the trunk of a tree. She had a few tender leaves on her hand. She was surrounded by seven or eight deer. There was a competition among the animals to eat the leaves in her hand. A deer calf was sitting on her shoulder eagerly looking at her face. Poonkuzhali and Amudhan froze in their places. The deer-calf on the lady’s shoulder was the first one to see them. It jumped down from the lady’s shoulder. Meanwhile the other deer saw them. The deer were ready to flee if the two decided to come any closer. The Mute Queen also saw the pair. Another strange voice came from her mouth. The deer ran away from the place. “My aunt does not know the language spoken by the people. But she knows the language used by these animals.” There was pride in Poonkuzhali’s voice. The lady did not run away now. She returned Poonkuzhali’s signal. When Poonkuzhali went near her she hugged her and kissed on her forehead. Chendan Amudhan was still standing at a distance. The aunt and her niece spoke for a while in sign language. Then Poonkuzhali asked Amudhan to come near. The mute queen looked at Amudhan. She then placed her hand on his head as if to bless him. Then she withdrew her hand. She then grabbed Poonkuzhali’s hand and dragged her away from that place. Amudhan followed them. The three reached the banks of the canal. The Mute Queen sat on the bank and waved her hands to Poonkuzhali. “Come, Amudha, let’s go. She says she won’t come. She wants her food to be brought here.”  They both started walking towards the light house. “What’s your answer to my question, Poonkuzhali?”  \\x0c“I had an idea of coming to Thanjavur with you. But that’s not possible now. My aunt wants to see her dear foster son. So I have to take her to Nagapattinam. If you come she might run away. I can’t get to know those things which I badly wanted to know.”  Chendhan Amudhan let out a long sigh. “Lady Luck has been avoiding me. Let me take leave of you now.”  “No, no. Come with me. To my house. Have your food, talk to your uncle and take leave of him. Otherwise they’ll shout at me.”  On the way they saw a man and a woman hiding behind a bush discussing something very serious. “Oh My God, that’s my sister-in-law, Rakkammal. Looks like her secret parleys are not yet over. Who is she talking to now? Are they the same spies from the Pandya Kingdom? Or somebody else?”  Poonkuzhali was talking to herself. Rakkammal emerged from behind the bush. She was a trifle shocked on seeing Poonkuzhali. But she hid her feelings and almost ran up to them. “Poonkuzhali, where were you all these days? Your father and your brother were  \\x0cvery much worried.”  “Why should they? This is not the first time I am going out of the house.”  “But this time you took your cousin along. They were worried whether you two had a secret marriage.”  “Anni, I have warned you several times not to utter such foolish things in my presence. If you do it again... well you had it.”  “No, not at all, my dear. You can marry your cousin or the Prince. Who the hell cares? Your aunt came from Lanka looking for you? Did you see her?”  “No. I did not.”  Poonkuzhali had a minute’s time to talk privately to Amudhan before they reached her house. “Careful, Amudha. Anni is a part of the spy ring of Pandya Kingdom. She’ll try to pull out the words from your mouth. Be very careful. Don’t answer any of her questions. Tell her you don’t know anything.”  “Let me also be dumb so long as I am here in your house.”  \\x0cThe same afternoon Poonkuzhali was rowing her boat towards Nagapattinam. The Mute Queen was the only other passenger in the boat. Poonkuzhali always used to be peaceful and at times even blissful while in the company of the Mute Queen. But this time Poonkuzhali was not. She remembered taking a sick Ponniyin Selvan in her boat only a few days ago. The memory of that trip came quite often. Now she felt that she took all the trouble only to unite the Prince with another Princess. She felt a sharp pain in her heart. She also felt bad for Chendan Amudhan. She had almost driven him away to his place. Her heart melted when she realised that she had been quite heartless with her cousin. More disturbing than these thoughts were the words of her father, Thiyaga Vidangaraiyar. Those were not words but warnings. “My dear child, it’ll be prudent if you can control your movements especially during these troubled times. I see new faces coming here quite often. I don’t know why they come here. I infer some conspiracy is being hatched in our Kingdom. I don’t want you to be caught in the net of conspirators. Our family is forever indebted to the family of the Chozha Kings. Never ever forget this, my child.”  When Poonkuzhali connected her father’s words and the clandestine activities of her sister-in-law her body trembled in fear. ‘Perhaps those strangers came looking out for me. Perhaps they want to know where Ponniyin Selvan is by following me. Oh My God, that would amount to compromising on his security. It’d be a great crime.’  \\x0cThe rustling sound heard near the banks increased her fears. There was no wind at that time. It appeared as if all the elements of Nature were conspiring to block the wind. In the absence of wind what would have caused that rustling sound? The mute queen was not disturbed as she could not hear any sound. There was no point in discussing that sound with her. But the other senses of the mute queen were abnormally sharper. She could use her eyes and brain to know what other people knew by their ears. And so long as she was there no danger can ensue to Poonkuzhali. But what’s happening? Even my aunt looks disturbed. She is anxiously looking at the banks of the canal. Is somebody following us? The reason for the mute queen looking at the banks with concern soon became clear to Poonkuzhali. And she felt relieved. There were about five or six deer in a place hidden in the bushes on the bank. They were peeping to look at the boat. No, not at the boat but at the Mute Queen. No other animal was as beautiful as deer. Why did God create men after creating such beautiful creatures like deer? Men are devils. There were men who were fond of hunting such beautiful animals! It was a shame on humanity. Poonkuzhali was absorbed in the beauty of the deer. Her hands stopped rowing. A strange sound came from the mute queen. That was not like the sound Poonkuzhali heard from her in the morning. There was immense fear and a sense  \\x0cof caution in the sound now. The deer heard the sound and started running away from the scene. At the same time an arrow came from nowhere and landed on one of the deer. The injured deer let out a pathetic wail. The mute queen jumped from the boat and ran towards the deer. As she came near the deer there was a rustling of leaves all around her. In the next few seconds she was surrounded by seven or eight men. They were armed with spears. Rakkammal, Poonkuzhali’s sister-in-law who had guided them to the place was seen at a distance. The mute queen tried to run away. She could not. When she learnt that all her escape routes were cut off she stood still. Two men came near her and bound her with ropes. All these happened in a few seconds in the sight of Poonkuzhali. When Poonkuzhali saw the Mute Queen being bound by those men she sprang from the boat and came running to the place screaming. She was using the oar as a weapon. Five or six men ran towards Poonkuzhali. They caught hold of her and dragged her to her boat. She was thrown into the boat and was bound by ropes. The men then went away. The Mute Queen followed them submissively. They all  \\x0cvanished from the place in a few seconds. Chapter 19 - The Laughter And The Fire  Poonkuzhali was struggling hard to release herself from the ropes that bound her to her boat. That was not an easy task. The crooks had tied the rope several times over and had made several knots. Poonkuzhali’s knife was lying on the boat floor. If only one of her hands were free she could have used it to take the knife and cut off the ropes. But those evil men had secured her wrists tightly to her back and then to the boat. Poonkuzhali strained herself to bend and grab the knife with her mouth. While holding the knife in her mouth she cut the rope at one point. The grip over one of her hands loosened. With great effort she freed one hand. Then it was pretty easy to free her completely. It took more than thirty minutes for her to free herself from the ropes. She heard the sound of footsteps. Then she saw a moving shadow. She thought that one of the captors had been left behind to make sure that she did not escape. The moment the person appeared before her she decided to throw the sharp knife at him and kill him. But what a disappointment! “Poonkuzhali! Poonkuzhali”  It was Chendan Amudhan’s voice. The next moment his terror-stricken face appeared on the banks. Poonkuzhali secured the knife in her waist. Amudhan too had seen her. “Poonkuzhali, are you alive?” - He came running towards her. “Why, you don’t want to see me alive? Do me a favour, please. Kill me with your own hands. But I know you are too timid to do that.”  “Oh My God! Why are you so harsh, Poonkuzhali? Why should I kill you? You are now killing me with your words.”  “Why didn’t you come a little earlier? You’ll never know how much I suffered to free myself from these bloody ropes.”  Poonkuzhali tried to stand. But as her legs were tangled in a maze of ropes she was about to trip. Amudhan rushed to her side and held her in his arms. “Oh My God, see what those crooks have done to you! I can see the rope marks all over your body.”  “If you are really concerned about me why didn’t you come a little earlier?”  “You have been asking the same question again and again. How could I know that you were in danger? You almost drove me away with your words. I was on the way to my town.”  “Then why did you come back? Perhaps to see if I am dead and perform the funeral?”  \\x0c“Legend says that my Lord Shiva had poison in his throat. And you have it on your tongue. Your sister-in-law told me that you might possibly be in danger. So I came running. And I have been amply rewarded for what I have done.”  Poonkuzhali had come to the bank by now. “I was about to throw this knife on you. You escaped. The first thing I am going to do is to kill my sister-in-law with this knife. Where is that devil?”  “Why are you pouncing on that woman? Why are you so furious with her? Is it an offence to ask me to help you out of danger?”  “No. She’s the one who betrayed my aunt. You also saw her talking to somebody hiding behind the bushes.”  “You are wrong, Poonkuzhali. I don’t know who she was talking to. But one thing is for sure. She did not betray your aunt. Those crooks who forcibly abducted your aunt had tied your sister-in-law to a tree. They also hit her on her head. She is badly hurt.”  “That’s strange! I can’t believe that! Looks like she has deceived you. But tell me why did you come back? Where did you see my sister-in-law? I want to know everything.”  Chendan Amudhan started a long narration. Chendan Amudhan was reluctantly walking on the road to Thanjavur. He did not have the heart to go away from Poonkuzhali. He heard somebody screaming from the forest near the road. He could also hear the sound of footsteps. Chendan Amudhan hid behind a tree on the road side. About seven or eight soldiers, all wielding spears, walked into the highway from the forest. Amudhan remembered to have seen a woman in their midst. The lady appeared like Poonkuzhali’s aunt. Amudhan first thought that it was only a hallucination. After the soldiers had gone away he heard a woman screaming for help. The scream came from the forest. His first instinct was not to get involved in what was possibly a crime scene. He wanted to ignore the call for help and go on his way. But then he decided to help the lady in distress and went in the direction of the sound. He saw Rakkammal bound to a tree. Blood was oozing from her head making her face a bloody mess. Amudhan was frightened. He did not have the heart to go near her. After some time he hardened himself and approached the woman. He freed her. As he was taking off the ropes he bombarded her with questions:  ‘Who did this? And why? Who were the men who just walked up to the highway from here? There was a woman in their midst. Who is she? “Yes, Amudha. They are kidnapping your aunt. I tried my best to prevent it. That’s why they beat me up and tied me to this tree. Your cousin, Poonkuzhali and your aunt were going in the boat. These men dragged your aunt from the boat. I don’t know what happened to Poonkuzhali. Please run. Otherwise it may be too late...”  \\x0cChendhan Amudhan was shocked. He started to run. “Just a minute, Thambi. Do you by any chance know where Poonkuzhali and that dumb devil were going? And why did they not take you with them? Where are you going alone, now?”  Amudhan did not like the way she talked. Especially the way she referred to his aunt as ‘dumb devil.’ “Will tell you later.” Amudhan muttered and ran towards the canal. His heart was in his mouth. What would have happened to Poonkuzhali? Would they have beaten her up? Or killed her? He heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Poonkuzhali alive and unharmed. “Now tell me Poonkuzhali, weren’t you wrong in accusing your sister-in-law?”  “Seems so. Where did you leave her? Let’s go there now.”  “Will she be there now?”  “She must be in the vicinity. Or she might come looking for us. Didn’t she ask where my aunt and I were headed to?”  “Yes, she did.”  \\x0c“I hope you did not answer her question. Are you sure?”  “I am. Since she referred to my Periamma as ‘dumb devil’ I was disgusted with her and did not have the mind to respond to her question.”  “Take it from me, even if she were to ask in all nice words, don’t tell her anything. Do you know why she is keen to know our destination? I don’t know; but I am sure she must have her reasons. I am not sure about her innocence. The crooks might have got the information through my sister-in-law and once their purpose was served they might have beaten her up and abandoned her. Even if that were not true she must have followed us with some evil intentions. So be careful with her. Don’t let her deceive you.”  “Poonkuzhali, I remember your saying that your brother acts dumb in the presence of his wife. Well, I’ll do the same. You do all the talking.”  Poonkuzhali laughed. “The sound of your laugh is like sweet honey to my ears. It appears as if I am hearing the sweet songs on my Lord composed by the great saint Thirunavukkarasar.”  “Well, my laughing was just an inadvertent act. Don’t’ be carried away by that. My mind is still boiling. A fire is raging in my heart.”  \\x0c“There is no better way to quell that fire than my Lord’s love.”  \\x0cChapter 20 - The Doctor’s Son Once Again  Poonkuzhali and Chendan Amudhan were walking through the forest. They were enveloped in a screen of uncomfortable silence. Poonkuzhali let out a long sigh and spoke in a soft voice. “Amudha, perhaps there’s something between us. We must have known each other in our previous births as well.”  “I am least concerned about our previous births. I’ll be grateful if you can give a favourable answer for something regarding this birth.”  “They say that the relationship two people shared in an earlier birth will continue in the next one as well. That must be true, Amudha. When we parted ways this afternoon I thought I will never see you again. But it was so ordained that we had to meet again within fifty minutes.”  “You need not grieve on that account. Once we cross this forest and reach the Thanjavur Highway I’ll go my way. You are free to do whatever you like.”  “I am not going to leave you like that, Amudha. After talking to my sister-in-law I’ll come with you to Thanjavur. I am going to seek justice for my aunt. I am going to complain at the Emperor’s Court.”  \\x0c“Poonkuzhali, do you still think it’s easy to approach the Emperor? Lay people like us cannot even enter the Fort, let alone the King’s Court.”  “Why not? If they refuse to open the Fort gates I’ll break them open. And if that is not possible I’ll scale the wall and jump in.”  “What will you do with the security guards on duty at the entrance of the Fort?”  “They will be simply frightened by my screams. They’ll take me to the Emperor.”  “I don’t think so, Poonkuzhali. You can’t easily frighten the person in charge of the Fort’s security - I mean the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar. People say that without the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s permission even the Lord of Death cannot enter the Fort. Some even say that the Emperor is still alive because of that.”  “What if I can’t see the Emperor? I’ll see the Pazhuvettaraiyars and seek justice for my aunt. And if I don’t get justice there I’ll run to the Chief Minister Aniruddha Brahmarayar. And if I fail to get justice there I’ll run to Pazhaiyaarai and complain to the Queens. I won’t rest till I know what happened to my aunt. I won’t sleep till she gets justice. Didn’t my sister-in-law say that my aunt is a ‘dumb devil’? Well, I’ll become a devil and roam in the cities and villages of this Kingdom. I will be crying ‘Justice’ ‘Justice’ as I wander in the country. Amudha, will you be me with in this?”  “Sure, Poonkuzhali, but only if you want me to come. But honestly why should  \\x0cyou let your mind swayed by emotions? You have gone way too far. Your first priority is to find where your aunt is and save her from danger. To free her from her evil captors. Shouldn’t you tell your father and brother about this?”  “Amudha, my aunt has divine powers. Nobody can harm her. Like the legendary Dhamayanthi who burnt the hunter with her powers she could burn her enemies by her mere glance. I am not worried about her. But I can’t bear to see such a gross atrocity happening in broad daylight in Chozha Kingdom. People say Paranthaka’s reign is one of righteousness. Ours is a country which was once ruled by the great devotee of Lord Shiva, Kandaraathithar. The tiger and the cow used to drink from the same pond. We have been living in that kind of peace and glory. Our Government is boasting that in Sundara Chozhan’s rule even a young woman can walk alone at night without any fear for her safety. Ours is such a glorious country. And in that country if criminals can abduct an old woman who can neither speak nor hear in broad day light, well to me, that’s the greatest of crimes ever committed in this country. I am not that concerned about my aunt. But whatever happened to her today can happen to me tomorrow. And can happen to any young woman living in this country. Chendan Amudhan spoke:  “Yes, we are surrounded by dangers at present. Ever since Sundara Chozhan became bedridden evil has gained an upper hand. Justice and righteousness have vanished. The ordinary men and women are not safe. And for the young girls of this country danger is waiting for them at every street corner. My suggestion to the young women of this country is “get married to the right man soon.”  Poonkuzhali laughed. “Amudha, if a young woman marries you, can you protect her? Do you know  \\x0chow to handle a sword? Do you know how to fight?”  “I only know how to make a garland of flowers. I only know how to sing the praises of my Lord. I have not learnt the art of fighting with a sword. So what? Didn’t you teach me how to row a boat? In the same way I’ll learn to fight. When Madhuranthakan can have the ambition of ruling this country, my learning to handle a sword is not so difficult a task.”  By that time, they had reached the place where Poonkuzhali’s sister-in-law was bound to a tree. They could not find her there. Amudhan showed the blood spots to Poonkuzhali suggesting that the blood might have come from the woman’s head. “It seems they have roughed her up. I am now sure that my sister-in-law was not working for the gang who abducted by aunt. But we should somehow know who she is working for.”  “Please listen to me, Poonkuzhali. Whatever has happened appears quite mysterious. Looks like there are secrets within secrets. All these complications involve the King and his family. Why should we bother about all these things? Why should we invite danger?”  “Amudha, let it be a sensitive political issue. Let it be a deep mystery. But tell me how can I stand off from something involving my aunt? And she’s your mother’s sister as well. How can you distance yourself from her?”  “I’m speaking what’s there in my mind, Poonkuzhali. Didn’t I tell you about the seven or eight men walking on the road and a woman walking with them in the  \\x0ccentre? Well, judging by the way she walked I don’t think that she has been abducted. It appears as if she was willingly going with them. I don’t think that she is forcibly taken.”  “Possible, Amudha. That is also possible. But that’s my aunt’s nature. She might want to know where she is being taken. And if she doesn’t like she can escape even from a thousand men. She can’t be imprisoned even in the mightiest of Forts and the worst underground dungeons. That was why I said that I am not concerned about her safety. My mission is to correct the injustice meted out to her. No, I am not talking about what happened today, but what happened twenty five years ago. That was the greatest injustice committed against a woman. I won’t rest till I seek retribution for that.”  “Oh My God! You’ve let your mind drift towards an impossible task.” Amudhan sighed. They heard somebody talking. One of the voices belonged to a woman. Amudhan and Poonkuzhali saw those who were talking at the Thanjavur High Road. One was Poonkuzhali’s sister-in-law Rakkammal. The person whom she was talking to was the son of the Chief Doctor of Pazhaiyaarai. Poonkuzhali was disgusted on seeing that worm. Rakkammal saw Poonkuzhali. “Oh, you are safe! I thought that they might have killed you. See, what those crooks have done to me! All because I tried to save your aunt! I was asking for  \\x0csome medicine from the Doctor’s son.”  “Even if the Karaiyar’s daughter is hurt I am ready to treat her.” - The Doctor’s son blurted out. Poonkuzhali did not respond to his offer. Instead she asked her sister-in-law:  “Anni, do you where the abductors are taking my aunt? Tell me which direction they took.”  “I didn’t see. But this Doctor’s son says that they went in the direction of Thanjavur High Road.”  “Anni, Amudhan and I are going to look for her. Please tell my father. Come, Amudha, let’s go.”  Poonkuzhali started to move. The Doctor’s son spoke to her. “Stop, Poonkuzhali. You two can’t go after them. They have horses which were waiting for them at a short distance from here. They would have ridden from there. I have a horse with me. I can chase them at the speed of wind and then come back to tell you about their whereabouts. And in return I want a small help from you. Just tell me where your aunt and you were headed for when the crooks  \\x0ccaptured her. Poonkuzhali spoke to her sister-in-law. “Anni, we do not need his help. We’ll find them on our own. Just tell my father.”  The Doctor’s son was quite adamant. “Aha, see the pride of Karaiyar’s daughter! She does not need my help. Girl, why are you so furious with me? Did I prevent you from marrying the Prince? You deceived me and took that man from Vaana Clan Vandhiya Thevan on your boat. And he killed the Prince by pushing him into the sea. What’s the point in being angry with me?”  The Doctor’s son laughed. There was fire in Poonkuzhali’s eyes when she stared at him. She then grabbed Amudhan’s hand and started walking up ahead. When she was out of their hearing range she told Amudhan, “When you first learn to fight with a sword you should kill this crook, the Doctor’s son. He should be the first victim of your sword, Amudha.”  They walked day and night on the road to Thanjavur. They asked the people on the way if any of them had seen seven or eight men going on horses along with a woman. They did have some information to start with. But after some time they were stonewalled. Everybody had witnessed that strange sight; but nobody could  \\x0csay who were they and where were they headed. They decided to go to Thanjavur anyway. Chendan Amudhan found the travel quite interesting. Poonkuzhali was the main reason. Another reason was that he trained himself on using the sword. He bought a sword near Kodikkarai from a blacksmith known to Poonkuzhali. While walking on the road he was constantly swirling the sword as if he were fighting with an enemy. His lack of training showed in the haphazard way he turned around the sword. At those times Poonkuzhali taught him how to hold a sword and how to wield it against an enemy. The training session made the travelling experience memorable to both. Only when they saw the Thanjavur Fort at a distance Poonkuzhali became serious. Chendan Amudhan shared her concern. Even to enter the Fort was a feat; how were they going to take their prayer for justice to high places? Amudhan remembered the tricks played by Vandhiya Thevan in a similar situation. Should I not have at least a tenth of his smartness? How good it would have been if Vandhiya Thevan is here with me to guide me in this critical mission. If Vandhiya Thevan is caught in a situation like this, what will he do? How will he act? They saw a closed palanquin going to the Fort. The sun had just set and a blanket of darkness was being slowly spread over them. There were pictures of palm tree on the screen that covered the palanquin. ‘Oh My God! This seems to be the palanquin of the Junior Queen. If only we could get her signet ring, all our problems will be solved.’  Amudhan shared his thoughts with Poonkuzhali. ‘Not a bad idea’ Poonkuzhali told him. But how was he going to draw the attention of the Junior Queen who was inside the closed palanquin? There were armed guards in front of the vehicle as well as in the back. The guards might not even let him go near the palanquin. “Don’t worry, Amudha the Fort is still a mile away. We’ll have enough opportunities.”  And they got a wonderful opportunity in the most unexpected manner. Chapter 21 - The Palanquin Ride  The arrival of the monsoon was delayed that year. The rains appeared to start but they never did. There were a couple of false starts and the dry weather continued. The water flow in Cauvery and its tributaries had considerably gone down. The farmers had planted hoping for a good monsoon. The saplings were about to wither for want of rains. “It’s all because of that evil comet” - people shifted the blame to the inanimate comet. “The Kingdom is in a mess.”  “The political affairs are in a state of confusion.”  “No news about the Prince.”  “And now the rains have failed us.”  Chendan Amudhan and Poonkuzhali were hearing this refrain throughout their journey. Of course the absence of rains made their travel faster and more comfortable. The days were clear. The afternoons were sultry. Even while walking under the shady trees of the highway they sweated. “Doesn’t look like the rainy month of Aippasi. It appears as if we are in the middle of summer - in the month of Vaikasi.”  Soon after the Pazhuvettaraiyar’s palanquin passed by their side they experienced a cool breeze. The leaves on the trees rustled in the wind creating a pleasant noise. They could see dark clouds in the north eastern horizon. In a short time the clouds were rushing towards them as if they were a herd of elephants on the run. The breeze became a strong wind and then a gale. The wind carried small droplets of water which fell on them. It started with a drizzle. And then it became a torrential downpour. It was difficult to describe the plight of the roadside trees in the wind and rain. The branches broke down. The birds which had nested in the branches flew in all the directions. The people walking on the road ran for cover. Some were afraid of the wind and the rain and so they started to run. Others were afraid of the tree branches falling over their heads. They too ran. Some feared that that it was the onset of the apocalypse and hence ran away in mortal fear. The day faded into night. Chendan Amudhan and Poonkuzhali abandoned the thought of entering the Thanjavur Fort before nightfall. They decided to go to Chendan Amudhan’s garden outside the city limits. They walked on the streets carefully providing support to one another. “Poonkuzhali, you must have seen many a storm and rain in the high seas. You have rowed your boat in the middle of huge mountains. I am surprised to see you afraid of this rain.”  “However strong may be the storm or the rain, when you are in the middle of the sea no tree will fall on your head. At the most you might be struck by a lightning.”  Even as Poonkuzhali was talking they could hear a tree crashing at a distance. Amudhan gripped Poonkuzhali’s hands and stopped at that place. “There is no point in going further in this weather. There are some mandapams on the road side. Let’s stay in one of them till the weather gets better.”  “Agreed! But how do we find a mandapam in this darkness?”  “We have the lightning to guide us. We will have to see on both the sides very carefully.”  Very soon there was a lightning. It bathed the sky and the earth in glorious light. “I can see a mandapam there!”  Poonkuzhali too saw the structure. She also saw a huge tree that had just fallen down. It appeared as if some people were caught under the tree. “Amudha, did you see the fallen tree? Can you see beneath the tree.. “  “Yes, I did. Fast. Let’s run to the mandapam, otherwise we’ll also be trapped.”  He held her hand and ran towards the building. They reached the mandapam soon. They squeezed the water from their dresses. Poonkuzhali tried to dry her long hair. The water from their dresses ran through the building. “God, we have made the place wet.”  “That’s okay, Poonkuzhali. The mandapam won’t be hurt. I don’t think it’d have cold or fever because of this running water. You are fully drenched.”  “I was born and brought up in the sea. I have another name, Samudra Kumari. The rain water cannot harm me.”  Her mind leapt from that road-side mandapam to the Choodamani Monastery of Nagapattinam. The person who first called her ‘Samudra Kumari’ was in the monastery. “Poonkuzhali my garden and hut is quite near. As soon as the rain abates we’ll  \\x0cgo there. My mother will take good care of you.”  Poonkuzhali did not hear Amudhan’s words fully. There was a flash of lightning. They were shocked by what they saw. A big banyan tree had fallen down at a place almost opposite to the mandapam. Its branches and aerial roots were everywhere. Two horses and about five or six people were trapped under the fallen tree. A few others were trying to rescue those people. They were trying to remove the branches. “Here” “There” “Fast” “Aiyoo”, “Oh My God” - the sound of rain was punctuated by the sounds heard from the place. But something else caught the attention of Chendan Amudhan and Poonkuzhali. There was a palanquin on the ground near the fallen tree. Two men were standing guard for the palanquin. The rest were perhaps involved in the rescue operations. “Amudha, did you see the palanquin?”  “Yes, I did. Looks like the palanquin of the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur.”  “It would have been better if the tree had fallen on the palanquin.”  “Oh My God! Why are you saying that? Didn’t you say that you wanted to meet the Pazhuvur Queen and get things done through her?”  \\x0c“Yes, I did. But I don’t like that woman.”  “If you don’t like somebody then a tree should fall on them, right?”  “Should trees fall only on ordinary people? Should it not fall on queens and princesses? That’s ok. Shall we go to the palanquin and speak to the Pazhuvur Queen? Shall we seek her help to enter the fort?”  “You have chosen the best time to see her. If we go near the palanquin now we might be mistaken as robbers and might be beaten up by the guards.”  “If only I am able to see her then things will be easy.”  “How?”  “I’ll drop my sister-in-law’s name. Or tell her that the sorcerer Ravidasan sent me.”  “Good idea. But how are we going to go near her?”  There was a flash of lightning. They saw two men lifting the palanquin. Oh My God, have they started? No, no. Looks like the palanquin is coming here. In a few seconds the palanquin reached the entrance of the mandapam. The bearers gently placed it on the floor. “Perhaps the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur is looking for us.” - Poonkuzhali. Amudhan gripped her hand and tried to move further inside. Poonkuzhali resisted his move. There was a commanding voice - “Who’s there?”  Poonkuzhali knew that the voice belonged to one of the bearers. “Don’t worry, brother. We too are travellers like you. We too have come here because of the rains.”  “Ok. But don’t come near the palanquin.”  “Why should we do that, brother? One has to have some good fortune to ride in a palanquin.” - Poonkuzhali answered him. Amudhan too joined the conversation. “While talking about the good deeds in the past the great poet Thiruvalluvar has spoken about riding in a palanquin.”  “Enough. Keep your mouths shut. How many of you are there?”  “We are only two. But this mandapam can hold even two hundred.”  Amudhan told what he believed to be true. He did not know that there was a third person in the mandapam hiding behind one of the pillars. The palanquin bearer spoke to his companion. “I told them, you know. That we can take shelter in the mandapam when the rains came. They did not listen. If they did this would not have happened.”  “Who knew this will happen? We thought that we can reach the Fort before the rains became stronger. Thank God, the tree did not fall on the palanquin.”  There was another flash of lighting. The eyes of Amudhan and Poonkuzhali did not move away from the palanquin. They could see a woman in the palanquin. She moved away the screen to have a look at them. She recognized them and smiled. The next moment the place plunged into darkness. Poonkuzhali spoke almost in a whisper. “Did you see, Amudha?”  “Yes.”  “Did you see who’s in the palanquin?”  “Is it not the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur?”  “What do you think?”  “Looks like the Pazhuvur Queen. But I am doubtful.”  “But I don’t have any doubts. I am very sure.”  “Sure of what?”  “It’s not the Queen of Pazhuvur. It’s my aunt, the Mute Queen.”  \\x0c“Sh.. don’t shout.”  “Unless I shout it won’t happen.”  “What should happen?”  “The one for which we came all the way. We have now found our aunt. Shouldn’t we rescue her and take her back?”  “That’s impossible, Poonkuzhali. We’ll follow the palanquin and find its destination. Then we can plan our rescue operations.”  “Why are you beating around the bush? I am not for it. I want to get her released right now. If you are afraid you keep quiet.”  “But Poonkuzhali your aunt should be willing to be released. It appears as if she is going on her own free will, majestically riding in a palanquin. Where is she going? What for? Who ordered her capture? Should we not know the answers to all these questions?”  “Maybe she is being taken to the underground dungeons. Once she is imprisoned there we can’t do anything.”  “Why not? I was in those dungeons once and I came out. I do have some influence in the Palaces in Thanjavur. I’ll try to get your aunt released. Keep  \\x0cquiet now.”  Poonkuzhali wanted to be patient. She did not want to do anything. But something unexpected happened. The screens of the palanquin moved apart. A figure came out. It walked like a cat without making any noise. The next second it was near them. As all this happened in total darkness it escaped the eyes of the bearers and guards. Poonkuzhali knew for sure that it was the Mute Queen. The Mute Queen held the hands of Amudhan and Poonkuzhali and dragged them to the back of the mandapam. She then hugged Poonkuzhali and kissed on her forehead to express her happiness. The aunt and niece talked for a while in sign language. How could they do that in utter darkness? How could they communicate to each other? That was something beyond explanation. Poonkuzhali then spoke to Amudhan. “Can you understand what she says? She wants me to go in the palanquin. She wants you to take her to your place.”  “What do you think, Poonkuzhali?”  “That seems to be a good idea. We’ll know the identity of her captors.”  \\x0c“Think it over, Poonkuzhali. Yes, it’s a good idea. But is it not very risky?”  “Don’t worry, Amudha. I won’t be harmed. I have this knife in my waist. I’ll take care.”  Poonkuzhali hugged her aunt and took leave of her. And like her aunt she walked like a cat silently towards the palanquin. She got into the palanquin and pulled in the screens. Chapter 22 - Chief Minister Aniruddhar Disappointed  Chief Minister Aniruddha Brahmarayar had been camping in the capital for a few days. His Palace was buzzing with activity. Government officials, Chieftains, Generals, Foreign Ambassadors, Representatives of Traders’ Groups, Trustees of Temples, Tamil and Sanskrit scholars swarmed to his Palace to have private audience with him. The Chief Minister did not have any security guards for him. He kept his official retinue to the barest minimum. That minimized the possible friction between the Chief Minister and the Pazhuvettaraiyars. Even then the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar was not happy about the Chief Minister extending his stay in the Capital. He thought that the security arrangements were a little lax ever since the Minister arrived in the city. All and sundry made their way into the Fort on the pretext of seeing the Chief Minister. The Chief Minister’s palace was adjacent to the King’s main Palace and the crowd in the Ministers palace seeped over to the main palace. Of course Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar, though the official commander of the Fort’s security, could not prevent anybody who had the Chief Minister’s signet ring, from entering the Minister’s palace. The Junior was not at all happy with the state of affairs. He did not have the courage to confront the Chief Minister and sort out the matters with him. If his brother, the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar were there in the city, the two brothers would have discussed the issue and would have found a smart solution. But unfortunately the Senior had gone to Kadambur. Without his elder brother the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar, also known as Kalaanthaka Kandar, felt that one of his hands had been taken away. And as if to add fuel to the fire the Chief Minister was frequently sending orders to the Junior in the pretext of seeking his help in  \\x0cadministration. A few days ago the Chief Minister wanted some soldiers to be sent to Kodikkarai for some important work. The Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar obliged. And the previous day the Minister wanted the closed Palanquin of the Pazhuvur Palace along with the bearers to bring a lady of high rank to his Palace. The Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar complied with this request as well. But he started thinking. ‘The Minister is involved in some conspiracy. Who is the high society woman who has to be brought in the closed palanquin? And why is she brought here? I should find that out. What a pity! My brother is not here at this time! How am I going to handle this situation?’  Along with the Pazhuvettaraiyar another person was also keen on knowing the identity of the woman who was being brought to Aniruddhar’s Palace - the Chief Minister’s most trusted disciple, Azhwarkkadian. On the day after the heavy rains the Chief Minister got up early, finished his ablutions, had his breakfast and came to the entrance of his Palace. He sent a man to find out who were waiting to see him. When he heard that Azhwarkkadian was one among them he ordered to bring him right away. Azhwarkkadian stood before his mentor with all reverence and humility. “Thirumalai, what happened to your mission?”  “Failure, Master.”  “I expected that. Were you able to meet the Crown Prince?”  “I did meet him, Master. I told him whatever you wanted me to tell him. But they were of no use, Master. I couldn’t prevent the Crown Prince from visiting the Kadambur Palace.”  “Is the Prince still in Kadambur?”  “Yes, Master. I saw him entering Sambuvaraiyar’s palace and then came back. The Prince was accorded a grand reception. I don’t have words to describe the enthusiasm of the villagers who assembled on the occasion.”  “I expected. Who else have come to the Kadambur Palace?”  “Parthibendran and Vandhiya Thevan have come along with the Prince. Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar and his queen have gone from here. I heard that the Chieftains from the Middle Provinces and Thirumunaippadi region have been invited.”  “What about Thirukkovilur Malaiyaman?”  \\x0c“He accompanied the Prince till Manimutha River. And then went back.”  “The old man can’t keep quiet. He would have started gathering an army by now. I hear that the Kodumbalur Chieftain has gathered a huge army and is marching towards the Capital from South. God should save this country from danger. Thirumalai, did you hear what the people of the Chozha Kingdom are talking about?”  “They are talking mainly about the drowning accident involving the younger Prince. They are furious over Pazhuvettaraiyars. Some are even blaming you, Master.”  “They are after all right. I deserve the blame. I am planning to resign my Minister’s job.”  “Master that would be a grand release for me! I’ll then travel to all the places singing the compositions of Azhwars. I’ll lead a happy, care-free life. Tell me, Master, when are you going to quit? “I am planning one last time to save this country from danger. I’ll quit my post soon after that.”  “What are you going to do, Master?”  “The first step of my plan has already been executed. Thirumalai you should know that I have succeeded in a task which you said is impossible for you.”  \\x0c“That’s no surprise, Master. But what’s the task, Master?”  “Didn’t I ask you to bring the crazy, dumb woman roaming in the Lankan islands? But you said that you can’t do it.”  “Yes, I did, Master. The dumb lady…. “  “I brought her to my palace yesterday night.”  “That’s nothing short of a miracle, Master. But how did you do it?”  “I expected that dumb lady would come to Kodikkarai to know if the younger Prince survived the storm. I had sent men to capture her if she resisted. Thank God, she did not give much trouble. She let herself to be brought here. And Thirumalai you are not going to believe this. I had her brought from Thiruvaiyaaru in the closed palanquin belonging to the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur.”  “But, Master, there were heavy rains yesterday and possibly a storm too?”  “Yes. That delayed her journey. I was worried. It was only after the palanquin reached the Palace at midnight did I heave a sigh of relief.”  \\x0c“Oh it was midnight when she came? And you were up, Master, till that time to accord a rousing reception to her?”  “Yes, I was awake. But I did not go to receive her. I made the womenfolk of the Palace receive her. I knew she was a crazy woman. I was worried that she might fight with me. Thank God nothing of that sort happened. She ate well and soon slept. Thirumalai, to confess the truth, I am still afraid to see her. Thank God, you came at the right time. We can see her together.”  “Master, I too am eager to see her.”  “Then come, let’s go to the ladies’ chambers. I presume that the lady knows you already. She also knows that you are dear to the younger Prince. She might have a soft corner for you.”  The Master and the disciple walked to the ladies’ chambers. The Minister ordered the maids to bring in the woman who came in the previous night. The maids brought in the lady. Aniruddha Brahmarayar was shocked. There was a sarcastic smile on Azhwarkkadian’s face. Chapter 23 - Can a Dumb Woman Speak? Aniruddha Brahmarayar was staring at Poonkuzhali for some time. Then he summoned the maids who brought her. In a barely audible whisper he sought some information from them. And when he got what he wanted he sent them away. He then turned towards Azhwarkkadian. “Thirumalai, something has gone wrong. Terribly wrong!”  “I too think so, Master.”  “This woman is quite young. She’d be twenty at the most.”  “Not even twenty, Master.”  “The woman I was expecting should be forty.”  “More than that, Master.”  \\x0c“Yes, yes. You have seen Mandhakini Devi in Lanka, right?”  “Yes, Master. I have. And I also tried to bring her here as per your orders. But I could not.”  “This woman is not Mandhakini Devi.”  “No, Master. She is definitely not.”  “Then who is this woman? And how did she come here?”  “Why don’t we ask her, Master?”  “What’s the point in asking a dumb woman?”  “Gurudeva, is this lady really dumb.. .”  “I asked the maids. They say that she has not spoken anything ever since she came here.”  “I have a doubt, Master. Whom did you send to bring this woman?”  \\x0c“Oh My God! You mean to say that the idiot has messed up?”  “Which idiot, Master? I don’t think you would have sent an idiot for a critical mission like this.”  “He appeared to be smart. When I went to Pazhaiyaarai a young man fought with Vandhiya Thevan, the warrior from the Vana clan. Do you remember my telling you about him?”  “Yes, Master. He is the son of the Chief Doctor of Pazhaiyaarai. His name is Pinaakapaani.”  “The same fellow. After sending you and Vandhiya Thevan to meet Karikalan I got this fellow released from the prison. I thought he’d be ideal for our espionage work. I sent him to Kodikkarai. Looks like he has visited the place earlier and knows about it.”  “You mean to say, Master that he brought this lady here?”  “I described the woman to be brought here. I gave him all her identifying marks. He brought her to Thiruvaiyaaru and sent a message to me about the success of the mission.”  “Master, I am dying to see the spy who succeeded in the mission in which I failed. Where is he now? Why don’t we ask this girl herself?”  \\x0c“Good idea. But he met with an accident last night.”  “Oh My God! What happened, Master?”  “He was walking behind the palanquin. I had ordered them to come into the Fort only in the night. Accordingly they left Thiruvaiyaaru late in the evening and reached the Fort in the early hours of night. I think you know about the sudden storm last night.”  “Yes, Master. I too was worried about the storm. I was afraid. I took refuge in a road-side Mandapam when the storm was in full fury.”  “When the palanquin was near the gates of the Fort a huge tree on the road-side fell down. The palanquin had a narrow escape. The tree fell on those who came behind the palanquin. The Doctor’s son was caught underneath the fallen tree.”  As the Chief Minister was talking they heard a high pitched female voice. “Only the tree fell on that devil? And not the lightning? And the thunder? Very sad. Very, very sad.”  There was so much fury in that voice. The two men turned around. The Chief Minister looked at Poonkuzhali. He was surprised. “Thirumalai, did this lady speak?”  “Yes, Master. I think so.”  “Surprise of surprises! How can a deaf girl hear, or a dumb woman speak?”  “Yes the deaf hearing and the dumb talking are matters of great surprise. But, Master, you are an ardent devotee of that all-powerful God Vishnu. Anything can happen if only you set your mind to it. Our Azhwar says in this context.. “  “Stop it, I say. Don’t drag the Azhwars into this. This is not due to the grace of Lord Vishnu. Something has gone wrong. This girl has cheated us. Who is she? What is her motive? Why did she act like a deaf and a dumb woman all along?”  “Why don’t we ask her Gurudeva?”  “Thirumalai, when I see the mischievous smile dancing on your face I strongly suspect that you know everything. Ok, let me ask this woman. Hey girl, aren’t you deaf? Do you hear me?”  “It would have been better if I had been deaf. But right now I am happy that I can hear you. Didn’t I hear you say that the devil was caught under the falling tree? My Lord, tell me, is that devil dead?” - Poonkuzhali talked with fervour. “Aha, you can hear. And you can talk too. So you are not dumb after all.” The Chief Minister pronounced with a flourish. “This girl is not dumb. I am so very sure about it.” Azhwarkkadian too joined the game. “Aha, at last you have found out that I am not dumb. I have heard that the Chief Minister Aniruddha Brahmarayar is the most intelligent person in the Chozha Kingdom. Looks like that’s true, My Lord.”  “Hey Girl, are you making fun of me? Beware! If you are not dumb why did you act so since last night? Why didn’t you speak anything ever since you came here. I want nothing but the truth. SPEAK!”  “My Lord, I had the ability to speak till I reached your Palace yesterday night. People at my place used to call me a chatter-box. I never stop talking. But when I saw your Palace and when I received the royal hospitality from the women of your household I was stunned. Too stunned to speak, my Lord. Your women spoke to me in the sign language. I thought all of them are dumb. I took pity on them and spoke to them in sign language, my Lord. Only after I heard you now did I remember that I too can speak.”  “I have no doubt that you are a loquacious lady. I am surprised how the Doctor’s son was able to capture you. He might be a fool; but in a way he’s smart.”  “My Lord, that crook did not capture me. If only he had tried that he’d be the honourable guest of the Lord of Death by this time.”  \\x0cPoonkuzhali drew the knife from her waist and showed it to the Chief Minister. “May you be blessed, Girl. But first keep the knife in its place. Why are you so furious with him? After all he did not capture you.”  “No he did not. But his men tied me to my boat. They also tied my sister-in-law to a tree. And to cap it all that devil of the Doctor’s son told me that he did not have any hand in that.”  “To that extent at least, he’s smart. He followed my instructions to properly.”  “Oh My God, Honourable Chief Minister, my Lord, was it you who sent that crook? Was it you who ordered that my aunt be caught and brought before you?”  “Your aunt? Is Mandhakini your aunt? Then tell me how are you related to Thiagavidangar, the care-taker of the light house?”  “I am his darling daughter, my Lord.”  “I never knew that Thiagayavidangar has such a loquacious daughter.”  “Will you please do me a favour?”  \\x0c“Sure, my child.”  “Don’t tell this to anybody.”  “But why, girl?”  “The whole country is praising you. They say that you know everything. Nothing happens in this Kingdom without your knowledge. If you proclaim your ignorance in a simple matter like this your reputation will go for a toss.”  “Hey girl, I don’t care about my reputation. Now please enlighten me on something else too. You said that your aunt was captured by some men. Do you know where they are? How did you get into the palanquin I sent for your aunt? Where did you get in?”  “My Lord, first tell me why did you send your men to capture my aunt, a dumb, harmless and an innocent woman.”  “I can’t reveal that to you, my dear daughter. That’s classified information.”  “My dear father, then I too can’t answer your question.”  “I know how to make you talk.”  \\x0c“Your methods won’t work with me.”  “I can send you to the underground dungeons.”  “No prison can hold me.”  “No one who has gone to the underground dungeons has come back. It’s a point of no return.”  “Wrong, again, my Lord. I know a person who came back from the underground dungeons. Even yesterday I was travelling with Chendan Amudhan. I was talking to him all the way.”  “Who is Chendan Amudhan?”  “He is the son of my other aunt. We two were travelling from Kodikkarai together.”  “What for, my child?”  “To see the palaces, mansions and other high rise buildings of Thanjavur. I’ve wanted to see them for quite some time. I also wanted to meet the Emperor. I heard that the Emperor is sick. How is he doing now? Can I see him, my Lord?”  \\x0c“There’s no improvement in his condition, my child. So, please forget meeting him.”  “How can I, my Lord? I have to see him. I should tell him that women are not safe in his great country, that they are forcibly kidnapped by people in power.”  “Hey girl, I don’t have the time to argue with you. My orders were not to capture you. Tell me first how you got into the palanquin I sent for somebody else. Did somebody force you into the palanquin?”  “No, my Lord. When I was near the Thanjavur Fort I saw a vacant palanquin. It was raining outside. Just to escape from the rain I got into it.”  The Minister now spoke to his disciple. “I now understand. They must have kept the palanquin down during heavy rain. At that time this girl must have changed places with her aunt. The Doctor’s son was under the tree and was unconscious. He could not have noticed the change of occupants. Nor did the bearers see the women trading their places. This must have happened near the Fort. Thirumalai, is my guess right?”  “Perfect, Master! I saw that happening with my own eyes.”  “WHAT? DID YOU SEE THAT? Then why didn’t you say that earlier? Tell me what happened.”  \\x0c“Yesterday night I was walking towards the Fort. It was raining heavily. Trees were falling down. I decided to stay for a while in a road-side mandapam. Soon after I went in, this girl and a young man came in. That man must be her cousin. In the flash of lightning I saw the beads on his chest. I thought he must be a strong Saivite. I wanted to talk about the greatness of Vaishnavism to him, more to while away the time than anything else. “Meanwhile some men brought a palanquin into the mandapam. I saw the Palm Tree insignia on the screen of the palanquin. A lady got down from the palanquin. These three people - I mean the lady, this girl and the young man were talking to each other in sign language in the cover of darkness. Then I saw this girl getting into the palanquin. From the frequent flashes of lightning I could find out that the person who got into the palanquin was different from the one who got out. The bearers did not notice the change. When the rain stopped they carried the palanquin away from the mandapam.”  “Aha! They have cheated me! But why did you keep quiet till now? What happened to those two people?”  “They left the place a few minutes after the palanquin. I too left the place.”  “Thirumalai, why were you a silent spectator? Why didn’t you stop this girl’s aunt? Are you a part of their conspiracy?”  “Oh My God! What words, my Master! I won’t even think of committing such a cruel betrayal. First, I never knew that you were behind the abduction drama. Because the palanquin belonged to the Pazhuvur Palace. So I thought that the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar was abducting that lady. Moreover how can I stop  \\x0cMandhakini Devi? One can even stop the storm; but not the Mute Queen, Master. I have tried that in Lanka and have failed. Again, the lady knows me. If she sees me she’d run away. Then nobody can get her.”  “Coming to think of it, I feel that the Doctor’s son was a lot smarter than you. He has at least brought the lady up to here.”  “Master, your inference is not right in this matter. Mandhakini Devi would have come on her own. And must have changed her mind at the last moment, when she was near Thanjavur.”  “May be! She could not have gone far by now. It was raining almost for the whole of last night. She should be somewhere near here. Thirumalai, we should somehow get her here. Perhaps this girl may know where she is staying. Hey girl, what’s your name?”  “Poonkuzhali, My Lord.”  “Aha, what a beautiful name! When it comes to giving names to his children there is nobody who can beat Thyagavidangar. Poonkuzhali, you know where your aunt will be now. If you do, please let me know. I promise you we won’t harm her.”  Poonkuzhali thought for some time. “My Lord, I know where she will be now. If you tell me why you sent your men  \\x0cto capture her I will share her whereabouts with you.”  “Poonkuzhali, that’s a politically sensitive issue. It’s about a secret that concerns the Palace. I can’t share that with you.”  “Then I can’t tell you where she is.”  “There’s no point in talking to this headstrong girl.”  “My Lord, if you accept my condition.. .. “  “Aha, see this girl is trying to impose a condition.. on me… Okay, tell me what’s your condition? “  “If you promise me that you’ll make my aunt sit on the Chozha Throne and wear the crown of the Chozha Empress I’ll bring her here.”  “Thirumalai, this girl has gone crazy.”  “Did you find that out only now, Master? Too late, Master. There is no need to ask her. I know where her aunt will be now. Her cousin Chendan Amudhan lives in a garden which is outside the gates of the Fort. He and his mother serve the Thalikkulathar temple by offering flowers for God. The woman you are looking for is at their place. If you send some men with me I’ll bring her here in no time, Master.”  \\x0cPoonkuzhali stared daggers at Azhwarkkadian. “If you try to do that I’ll complain to the Emperor. I’ll see to it that your atrocities are known to the whole town.”  “Thirumalai, we have to send her to the underground dungeons. There is no other way.”  “If anybody comes near me I’ll kill him.”  Poonkuzhali took out the knife from her waist and held it in a threatening fashion. “Master, there is no need to send this girl to the dungeons. Instead we can send her to Princess Kunthavai’s palace. I think Princess Kunthavai is here in this city at this moment. She’d cure this crazy girl. Perhaps she might want to get a few things done through this girl.”  “Why do you say that? How can this silly girl help Princess Kunthavai?”  “You don’t know, Master? The storm which we had here last night has wrought havoc in the coastal area of Chozha Kingdom. Messengers have come to you from all the four directions bearing the bad news.”  \\x0c“Yes, yes. Thanks for reminding me. I need to see them now. I’ve lost precious time talking to this silly girl. It could have been better if this girl had been born dumb.”  “Then you can carry on with your misdeeds with nobody to question you, right?” - Poonkuzhali spat fire. “Master, Nagapattinam is in great danger. I hear that that the sea has come into the town and the whole town is submerged.”  Both the Minister and Poonkuzhali were shocked by these words. “It’s quite possible, Master, that the Princess Kunthavai herself may come here to enquire about the calamity.”  As Azhwarkkadian was saying that they could hear people hailing somebody. “Thirumalai, when did you get the Third Eye? When did you get the ability to see the future? You are right. Looks like the Princess has arrived at my gates!”  The Chief Minister walked to the gates of his Palace. Kunthavai and Vanathi entered his palace through the same gate. When the Princess saw Poonkuzhali her face brightened. The look of concern and grief vanished from her face. Her beautiful face now shone with a feeling of surprise and happiness. Chapter 24 - The Anxiety Of The Princess  The Minister welcomed Princess Kunthavai and Princess Vanathi and gave them proper seats befitting their royal stature. “Your Highness, if only you had sent word to me I’d have come to see you. May I know the reason for this unexpected visit? Anything urgent, Devi? I hope the Emperor is doing fine.”  “The Emperor’s health is as usual. But he is unduly worried. He is very much disturbed by the storm and did not have a wink of sleep last night. He is anxious about the safety and well-being of the people, especially the poor people living in huts. He was talking about them all night. He almost ordered me to see you at dawn and request you to immediately provide assistance on a war footing to those who have been affected by the storm. I came here mainly to convey my father’s message to you.”  “What can this humble servant do, Your Highness? You know that I am the Chief Minister only in name. The Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar, who is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is unfortunately not in the city at this moment. I am sure he would have locked up the Royal Treasury and would have carried the keys with him. Even his own brother, the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar cannot open the treasury without the Senior’s consent. What help can I offer the poor and distressed, Devi? Your Highness might have seen scores of people waiting outside the gates of my palace. I am ashamed to see them, Devi. That’s why I am hesitant to even move out of my room.”  “You need not worry on that count, Minister. I’ll give all my personal belongings  \\x0cfor the relief work. My mother too is ready to give her personal assets. And you can take all the valuables in the Emperor’s Palace for the purpose. The Emperor authorises you to do that. Please do something to provide at least some kind of a temporary relief to those who are affected by the calamity.”  “Doing relief work with your personal assets will be like providing a single corn to the hungry elephant. The storm has affected the whole of the kingdom. We are yet to receive information about the extent of damage. And this man standing here, my most ardent disciple, Azhwarkkadian, has brought terrible news. He says that the sea has entered the cities and has drowned all the coastal towns from Kodikkarai to Nagapattinam.”  The Minister did not fail to observe the waves of shock that passed through the faces of the three women standing before him. He now spoke in a soothing voice:  “But I don’t believe his words, Your Highness. What he says is a rumour. As it usually happens, rumours travel faster than a cyclone. It is not possible to get information from the coastal towns so soon. Even if soldiers travel on the fastest horses the news won’t reach here before this afternoon. Meanwhile we can do whatever is possible from our end.”  Princess Kunthavai struggled hard to calm herself. “Minister Sir, I too heard the rumours about Nagapattinam. I have come to talk about that as well. Didn’t we grant some endowments to the Choodamani Monastery recently? And if the monastery is in danger, what will those poor  \\x0cmonks do?”  With these words she threw a pointed glance at Poonkuzhali. “Minister Sir, how did this girl come here? Isn’t she the daughter of Kodikkarai Thiagavidangar?”  “She is, Your Highness. But she is not soft-natured like her father. She has the nasty habit of poking her nose in to matters totally unrelated to her, embarrassing everyone around.”  Princess Kunthavai grew suspicious. Perhaps the Chief Minister had brought Poonkuzhali only to spy on the whereabouts of Prince Arulmozhivarman. She had grounds for her doubt. The Chief Minister was known for his smart tricks and intelligent manoeuvres. She decided to take sides with Poonkuzhali. “No, Minister Sir. I don’t agree with your assessment of her. Poonkuzhali is a nice girl. Poonkuzhali, come here. Why is the Chief Minister angry with you? Did you give him any trouble?”  Poonkuzhali came near Kunthavai. “Devi, why don’t you ask the Chief Minister himself? Did I give trouble to him or did he give trouble to me?”  \\x0c“Ok, dear. You too appear to be angry. Come closer, my girl. Come, sit by my side.”  Poonkuzhali obeyed. “Minister Sir, why did you bring this girl here? Anything important?”  “Your Highness, I did not bring this girl here. I did not even know that such a naughty girl lives in our kingdom. It’s all her making. She... came... ”  Poonkuzhali spat fire. “Devi, why should the Honourable Minister be hesitant to reveal the truth? Ask him to tell the whole story.”  The Minister spoke. “She came on her own looking out for her aunt.”  “Who is her aunt? Oh, Chendan Amudhan’s mother? I think their house is outside the Fort.”  “No, Your Highness. I am not referring to Amudhan’s mother. This girl has  \\x0canother aunt who is also dumb and deaf. You might have heard of a crazy, dumb woman wandering in the Lankan forests. I wanted to bring her here for an important work. I tried my best to do that. I almost succeeded. But you know in the last minute... this girl... “  Kunthavai’s excitement was beyond description. “Oh My God! Is it true? Where is that lady? I want to see her right now!” The Princess got up from her seat. “Please forgive me, Your Highness. This girl spoilt everything at the last minute.”  Kunthavai sat down disappointed. She then turned to Poonkuzhali. “Is that true, Poonkuzhali? You’d never know what you have done.”  “Devi, please ask the Minister what kind of tactics he employed to bring my aunt. Then you won’t blame me.”  The Chief Minister gave a brief account of the events. Princess Kunthavai listened to him with rapt attention. Finally she declared  \\x0c“Minister Sir, then she should be somewhere near the Fort. Why don’t you send your men to look out for her?”  “Thank God there is no need to search for her. My disciple here says that she is in Chendan Amudhan’s hut. And that my disciple saw her this morning.”  “Then what are waiting for, Minister Sir? Let other things wait. Let’s go. Let’s bring her here. If you are busy, I’ll go myself. Vanathi, let’s go!”  Azhwarkkadian intervened. “Let’s think before we act, Devi. If the lady sees strangers coming in a group she might be frightened and she’ll run away. It is easy to capture the cyclone but not that woman.”  The Minister endorsed his disciple’s views. “What my disciple says is correct. Poonkuzhali’s aunt might run away if she sees us as a group. Then all our efforts would go waste. What is your suggestion, Thirumalai?”  “Ask this girl Poonkuzhali to bring her here. There are only two people in the whole world whom the Mute Queen will listen to. One of them is this girl.”  “The other?” - Chief Minister was anxious to know. Azhwarkkadian hesitated for a while. “There’s a rumour that the other person is drowned in the sea.”  Kunthavai pretended not to have listened to Azhwarkkadian’s words. She addressed Poonkuzhali. “Dear Poonkuzhali, please bring your aunt here. I promise you that she won’t be hurt. I need to see her on a very important work. Will you do it for me?”  “Yes, Your Highness! But the Chief Minister ought not to have employed such cheap tactics to bring her here. If only I had known this earlier... “  “Yes, I do agree. When there is no transparency in our acts these lapses do occur. I have learnt that myself in a hard way. I am sorry. Bring your aunt here quickly. And you have one more work.” - Kunthavai’s words were soft and conciliatory. The Chief Minister now addressed his favourite disciple. “Thirumalai you go with this girl. If you experience any trouble in entering the Fort you can come to my Palace through the secret way.”  Poonkuzhali and Azhwarkkadian took leave of everyone and went away. Princess Kunthavai now spoke to the Chief Minister. “Minister Sir, you have a lot of visitors. Tell them what needs to be told. Send them away and come back. I want your advice on some crucial matters.”  “Give me a few minutes, Your Highness. I too need to talk to you.”  The Minister went away. Vanathi opened her mouth for the first time. “Akka, what is the other important work you have in mind for Poonkuzhali? Are you planning to send her again to Nagapattinam?”  “Yes, Vanathi. But don’t let that trouble you. Nothing will happen to Ponniyin Selvan.”  “Let me also go with her to Nagapattinam, Akka.”  “What will you do there, Vanathi? Then I need somebody else to guard you.”  “That boat-woman hates me, Akka.”  \\x0c“How did you read her mind?”  “She never talked to me. Not even once.”  “You also did not talk to her. And she did not talk to you.”  “I was looking at her face every now and then. But she did not look at me at all. Not even once! She seems angry with me. I don’t know why.”  “Yes, Vanathi. All the maidens in this country will be jealous of you. There is no point in grieving over it.”  \\x0cChapter 25 - The Chief Minister’s Fault’  The Chief Minister disposed of the visitors at the gates of his palace quite fast and almost ran back to the Princess. “Devi, I have done whatever is possible under the circumstances. I have sent men in all the directions to assess the damages caused by the storm. I have also sent word to the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar. I have requested him to open up the Royal Treasury and leave it under our joint custody.”  “Minister Sir, I hear that there is an underground treasure house near the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s house. Is it true that it holds invaluable treasures? The Queen Mother spoke to me about it.”  “The Queen Mother thinks that if that treasure is thrown open we can build a thousand temples in the country. I am the Chief Minister; but I have not seen it. Not even once, Devi. People who go there never come back alive.”  “Let it wait. Will those two bring the Mute Queen safely? I am worried that having come thus far we might let her slip out of our hands.”  “Your Highness, what do you know about that good lady? And how? Why are you so excited about her?”  “Minister Sir, the Emperor spoke about her a few days ago.”  \\x0c“Oh My God! Did he tell you that she is alive?”  “No, he did not. He recounted what happened twenty five years ago. The Emperor thinks that she is dead. That explains his troubled state of mind. He told me that it was you who conveyed the death news to the Emperor. Didn’t you tell my father that the lady jumped into the sea and killed herself? Then how did you know that the lady is still alive?”  “I was about to ask the same question to you, Your Highness? How did you know, Devi?”  “I have no qualms in sharing that with you, Minister Sir. The Warrior of the Vaana Clan who had been to Lanka told me about her. And then my brother Arulmozhi... “  Kunthavai realized her mistake and bit her lips. “Your Highness, if you do not want to talk to me about Arulmozhivarman let it be so. I will forget your mentioning his name in our conversation.”  “No, Minister Sir, I have decided to come clean on everything. That’s why I came here. There is no point in hiding things. It gives rise to unnecessary dangers and complications. I realized the truth of this statement last night. Please listen, Sir. My brother did not drown in the sea. He was saved by the King of the Sea, the Samudrarajan himself. He is now safe in the Choodamani Buddhist Monastery at Nagapattinam. I had been to Nagappattinam only to see him. I  \\x0calways had a doubt that you knew everything.”  “Your doubts are justified, Devi. But I never showed that I knew. I have a policy not to interfere in any of your matters, Devi. I have spared nobody but you, Devi. I have given orders to my men that they should never poke their noses in whatever you do. I strongly believe that you’ll always be just and right. Malaiyaman and I used to talk a lot about you. We used to say that had our Princess Kunthavai been born a man she would have brought the whole world under Chozha rule.”  “I confess that I too had a similar ambition. Though I was born a woman I wanted to fulfill my ambition through my brothers. But now I have abandoned my desires. I have come to the firm conclusion that women should never interfere in the political affairs of a country. It was me who made my brother stay in the Buddhist Monastery at Nagappattinam. See what has happened!”  “Nothing has happened, Devi. The King of the Sea was kind enough to rescue the Prince when he was drowning in mid sea. Do you think he will hurt him when he is on the shores, safe and secure?”  “Minister Sir, I want you to tell these words to my father. He is devastated.”  “Aha! Does the Emperor know that the Prince is in Choodamani Monastery?”  “I told him yesterday. I had to. There was no other go.”  \\x0c“Oh My God! We could have delayed telling him for a few more days. I thought your arrangement was brilliant. Devi, the entire country is fuming now. There was an external storm last night. But an internal storm has been raging in the minds of our people for quite some time. People are furious over Madhuranthakan and the Pazhuvettaraiyar brothers. People have come to know that it was the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar who sent ships to arrest the Prince. They also believe that it was the Pazhuvettaraiyars who killed the Prince. If the people know that the Prince is alive they will rise to action. There will be a mutiny. The people would want the Prince to be crowned right now. They won’t stop till the Prince is made the Emperor. The Pazhuvettaraiyars are waiting for some lame excuses to start a war. The Senior Velar of Kodumbalur is marching to the capital with a huge army. I am afraid that there is going to be bloodshed in a hitherto unknown scale in our Kingdom. I fear that this great Kingdom might be destroyed by sibling rivalry. I have been praying to Lord Renganatha day and night to avert that calamity.”  “My prayers are also the same. I don’t want any of my brothers to ascend the throne. I have killed that desire long back. I don’t have any objection to Madhuranthakan being crowned as the King.”  “You may not object, Devi. But the people will. By God’s grace the Emperor should live for many, many years. But if anything happens.... well... on that day there will be a great mutiny… “  “Minister Sir, I am afraid that the terrible event might happen pretty early. Yesterday the Emperor’s condition was quite serious. I was forced to tell him that Ponniyin Selvan was safe and sound. But he did not believe my words. He thought I was just giving him empty words of consolation. He is still under the hallucination that the ghost of that ‘evil woman’ is taking revenge on his sons.”  \\x0c“Oh My God! Devi, can you please tell me what happened last night?”  “I came here only for that, Minister Sir. I also want to seek your advice on some issues. Do you remember that once I came here to establish Sundara Chozha Hospital here in the capital? At that time the Emperor told me his life story. When he accidentally took refuge in an island near Lanka, a fisherwoman saved him from a charging bear. And then he lived a dream-life with that girl in that heavenly island. After some time he was taken to Thanjavur. He also remembers seeing her in the crowd at the time of his coronation. And then he sent his best friend, that is you, Minister Sir, to bring her. You went in search of her and then came back to report that she fell into the sea and died. From then on he has been telling that her ghost visits him often to torment him. And of late the ghost is coming often. That’s what he told me last night.”  “But Devi, do you believe him?”  “The story was quite unusual. Yes, I was confused. I first thought that the Emperor had lost his mind. Otherwise he would not complain about the ghost of the dead woman visiting him often. But as I started to think of those events I had other doubts. One day my friend Vanathi heard the Emperor screaming. She ran to his room. She saw a figure closely resembling the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur standing before the Emperor. The shock was too much for her. She fainted. From then on I started having doubts about the relationship between the Mute Queen and the Pazhuvur Queen. My doubts were confirmed by what Vandhiya Thevan and Arulmozhivarman said. Is Nandini Devi the mute woman’s daughter?”  “I too had those doubts, Devi. If we just consider the similarity in appearance that inference is inevitable. But can we decide solely on that? Nandini Devi could even be the mute woman’s youngest sister. There are only three people in the world who know about the relationship.”  \\x0c“Who are they?”  “The first is the Queen Mother, Sembian Madevi. She is guarding a secret in her heart which is eating her insides. But we can’t know what it is unless the Queen Mother herself chooses to share it with us. She revealed it to Emperor Kandaraathithar at the time of his death. Kandaraathithar started telling that secret to me. But before he could hardly speak two words he gasped for breath and died.”  “Who are the other two, Minister Sir?”  “The other two can’t speak. One is Chendan Amudhan’s mother. And the other is her elder sister, the Mute Queen. We can’t get anything from Amudhan’s mother. She is fiercely loyal to Sembian Madevi. So long as the Queen Mother is alive she won’t reveal the secret. That was the reason I took great efforts to bring Mandhakini from Lanka.”  “Oh, her name is Mandhakini? How did you know that she was alive?”  “Devi, I knew that twenty five years ago.”  “WHAT? YOU KNEW THAT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO? Then why didn’t you tell my father? Because my father believes that she is dead he has been suffering. And you know that very well, Minister Sir?”  “I know, Devi. I know.”  \\x0c“Even after knowing that why did you hide the truth from him?”  Aniruddhar let out a long sigh. From his facial expression Kunthavai could gather that his mind was in a state of turbulence. The Chief Minister started a long narration:  “Devi, I committed an offence twenty five years ago. I am confessing it to you for the first time. Nobody else in this world knows this. Yes, your father sent me to look out for that fisherman’s daughter. I went with some horsemen. We reached Kodikkarai. We learnt that she jumped into the turbulent sea from the light house. There were eye-witnesses to that ghastly act. Thiagavidangar, the caretaker of the light house, recounted the event in a trembling voice. I came back to Thanjavur and conveyed the news to my dear friend.”  “I don’t see your fault in any of these, Minister Sir.”  “Well, this is my offence. The fisherman’s daughter fell into the sea. But she did not die. A fisherman rescued her. He took her in his boat. And he reached the shore several miles away from Kodikkarai. As we were coming back from Kodikkarai I saw the boat coming in. I saw the woman in the boat. I knew who she was. I gave loads of money to the boatman and requested him to take her safely to Lanka and keep her there. I came back to Thanjavur and told the Emperor that the fisherman’s daughter was dead. I thought I was helping your father. I never thought that my lie would lead to such disaster.”  The Princess intervened. “Minister Sir, in a way that looks like your fault. But you did it with all good intentions. But tell me this; did you get any news about her?”  “Yes, I’ve been hearing about her. As soon as Sundara Chozhan was made a Crown Prince he went to the battlefront at Madurai. I went to Varanasi. I stayed there for a few years to learn our scriptures. I returned to Pazhaiyaarai after some time. One day I saw the father of Eesana Bhattar chatting with the fisherwoman. He revealed another secret to me. He told me that the fisherwoman stayed in the garden attached to the Queen Mother’s palace for some time. And that she gave birth to twins and then ran away from the place. He also told me that she used to come once in a way to see her children. I asked him about the children. He refused to say anything about them. He told me that it was a secret known only to the Queen Mother. I did not want to press him further. Devi, when Arulmozhi was a child he fell into the Cauvery River. People used to say he was saved by Mother Cauvery. But in reality he was saved only by the fisherwoman. I knew this even at that time.”  “What you say is true, Minister Sir. Arulmozhi saw the kind lady in Lanka and told me the same thing. But listen to this! Do you know what my father thinks? He thinks that the ghost of the fisherwoman comes often to wreak vengeance on his children. Last night when the great storm was raging outside, the storm inside my father’s mind was no less. He did not sleep even for a second. He did not let me sleep as well. He told me the old story once again. ‘That devil is seeking revenge. It was that devil who killed my Arulmozhi by drowning him in a storm. And she won’t rest till she kills Karikalan.’ He kept saying this again and again. He then passionately pleaded with the Lord of Death - “Please take me from this  \\x0cworld when at least one of my sons is alive.”  I consoled him. He did not listen. Finally I had no option but to tell him that Arulmozhivarman is safe in the Buddhist Monastery at Nagappattinam.”  “Was the emperor peaceful after that?”  “No, Minister Sir. He became even more agitated. First he did not believe the news. But then I told him that I saw the Prince in person. He asked me why I have not brought him here. I told him that he was not well and was not fit enough for the long journey. And that I’ll make arrangements for his journey as soon as he recovers from the illness. I also hinted about the complications that would follow if Arulmozhi appears on the scene now. As soon as he heard this his mind went in a different direction. ‘It’s this Kingdom that has become a problem to my children. If it is made clear that the throne is not for my children then they will live happily for a long time. That’s why I am anxious to bring them here and tell them that the throne is not for any of them.’  Suddenly he had another fear. The hurricane was so unusually strong that even the Palace was a little shaken. Once after a huge thunder blast my father became very emotional. ’My dear daughter I may not see Arulmozhi again. I know about the storms and whirlwinds of the Eastern seas. Today’s storm will make the waves near the shore rise up to the height of a coconut tree. The sea will enter into the land and large areas will be submerged under water. You know one day, long ago one of  \\x0cour towns Kaveripattinam went under the sea. Similarly the sea may enter Nagappattinam and gobble up the city. The Buddhist Monastery which is between the sea and the canal can never escape the storm. That devil of a lady could not drown him in the sea. Instead she is bringing sea into the land to claim his life. I am going now to foil her attempts.’  “My father was crying like a child, Minister Sir. He tried to get up from his bed. And then became weak again and lied down. Minister Sir, if you happen to hear the lamentations of my father. . . Well. .. Well… even the stone and the mountains will melt.”  There was an unending stream of tears from her eyes. Chapter 26 - The Commotion In The Streets  Vanathi could not bear to see Princess Kunthavai crying. She too started to cry. Aniruddha Brahmarayar had an iron heart. He had seen many a summer and had been seasoned by the woes and worries of lives in high places. Even then his heart melted on seeing the tears in the eyes of the Princesses. “Your Highness, I am the one who is responsible for all the sufferings of your father. I don’t know what atonement I have to do to wash away the sin.”  “Minister Sir, you know everything. And yet I venture to tell you what little I know. If only you can tell my father that the fisherwoman is not dead, he will find peace. His heartaches will vanish. I came here only to make that request to you. I also came to request you to somehow bring my stepmother. But now I see that you are already on the job.”  “I too had come to that conclusion, Devi. I had decided to tell the Emperor that Mandhakini Devi is alive. But he won’t believe my words. How can I make him believe that whatever I told him earlier was a lie and that what I am going to tell him now is the truth? That was the reason I delayed telling your father till I brought the lady here. And if the Emperor sees her in person he will have no choice but to believe, right? I went to the Lankan Island precisely for that reason. But the Pazhuvettaraiyars twisted the story. They told the Emperor that I was conspiring with your brother, Prince Arulmozhivarman and the Senior Velar of Kodumbalur to dethrone the Emperor. At least to prove my innocence I have to take Mandhakini Devi to your father, Devi.”  “But if my father sees her all of a sudden, will he be able to withstand the shock? I think we need to first prepare him for the meeting.”  “Yes, Devi, I had planned that too. I had planned to talk to the Emperor as soon as Mandhakini Devi is brought to this place. I had even planned to come to the Palace to meet the Emperor this morning. But Thiagavidangar’s daughter intervened and spoilt everything. I will see to it that the naughty girl is punished someday.”  “Please, Minister Sir, please spare her. I don’t know whether she is good or bad. But she is the one who saved Arulmozhivarman from drowning.”  “God saved him, Devi. The one who is forever sleeping in the Ocean of Milk, the Great Vishnu saved the Prince. This little girl could not have done anything without God’s help. If astrology is true, if stars and planets tell us about the future then even the fire and the floods, the storm and the earthquake cannot harm the Prince.”  “Nothing can happen without God’s grace. But even His grace has to come only through human beings. I had planned to send Poonkuzhali to Nagapattinam. But if you think otherwise... if you think that bringing the Prince here will be a better option... well... “  “No, Devi. Till the issue of succession is fully resolved let not the country know about the Prince. I am planning to discuss the issue with the Emperor. If he wants Madhuranthakan to be crowned as the King then it is better to send away Arulmozhi to Lanka again. People will never accept Madhuranthakan as the King so long as Prince Arulmozhivarman is here. There will be a civil war. Blood will be flowing in the rivers of Chozha Kingdom.”  \\x0c“Oh My God! Then do you think it will be a good idea to send Chendan Amudhan and Poonkuzhali to Nagapattinam?”  “I do, Your Highness. And if need be we can make Prince Arulmozhivarman to visit the capital city in cognito.”  “You are right, Minister Sir. If my father sees Mandhakini Devi and Arulmozhi, and is convinced that both of them are alive, he will be peaceful.”  “Does your father worry about the Crown Prince, Devi?”  “No, not at all. The Emperor is convinced that nobody in the world can harm Karikalan. What is your take on this, Minister Sir?”  “Honestly, Devi, I don’t believe that. I agree that the Crown Prince is invincible in the battle field. But it is not difficult to deceive him elsewhere. The Pazhuvettaraiyars are against him. The Junior Queen of Pazhuvur is engaged in a conspiracy against the Crown Prince. I managed to communicate the news to the Crown Prince through my disciple Azhwarkkadian. But my mission is a failure, Devi. The Crown Prince refused to visit the capital city in spite of repeated invitations from the Emperor; but he has now gone to Kadambur Sambuvaraiyar’s Palace.”  “Minister Sir, I have sent news to my brother Karikalan that the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur might probably be our sister. I have also requested the warrior from Vaana clan to guard the Crown Prince and never leave his side. If only Vandhiya Thevan were here.... we could have sent him to Nagapattinam.”  \\x0c“Then I would have sent my disciple to make sure that the young man is not caught in trouble. Even now if you decide to send Poonkuzhali I’d like to send my disciple Thirumalai.”  “But they have gone to fetch Mandhakini Devi. They haven’t come yet. If my step mother comes here, most of my problems will go away. And when the lady comes you’ll immediately bring her to my father, right? I need to tell my mother the whole story. I need some time to prepare her for the most emotional meeting of her life.”  “Aha! My heart goes for your mother, the daughter of Malaiyaman. What an agony for her! When your mother’s father the old man of Thirukkovilur knows about this... Oh My God! I can’t even guess how he will react. And if he knows that his grand children are not going to be Kings he might even be prepared to destroy the whole Kingdom.”  “Leave the job of pacifying my grandfather to me, Minister Sir. I am worried about the Senior Velar of Kodumbalur, who happens to be this girl Vanathi’s uncle. He is waiting for the day the Kodumbalur girl is going to adorn the Chozha Throne. I am sure even this girl wants the position.”  Vanathi shouted in fury “AKKA... “  Before Vanathi could talk any further, Poonkuzhali walked in. All of them were shocked to see her coming alone. “Hey girl! Where is your aunt? And where is Thirumalai?” - The Chief Minister was tense. “Sorry, Minister Sir, my pride has taken a severe blow. I could not bring her here as promised.”  “What happened? Did she vanish before you went there? Or did she refuse to come? Then. .. “  “No, Sir. We brought her into the Fort. Then she was caught in the crowd of people and disappeared.”  Poonkuzhali gave the full details:  Fortunately for them Mandhakini Devi was in Chendan Amudhan’s house. And she had reason to do so. Amudhan’s hut had been shattered in the storm. A tree had fallen on the hut. Chendhan Amudhan who was completely drenched in the rain was down with high fever. He was in a state of delirium. The two sisters Amudhan’s mother and his aunt - were busy removing the tree and cleaning up the house. Mandhakini was pleased to see Poonkuzhali again. But she was a tad hesitant to meet Thirumalai. Poonkuzhali explained to her that Thirumalai was on their side. Mandhakini was pacified. Poonkuzhali and Thirumalai had discussed how to present the case to Mandhakini even while walking to Amudhan’s house. Poonkuzhali faithfully carried out the plan. Accordingly she told the Mute Queen that the Emperor was in his death bed and that his end might come any time. And that he wanted to see Mandhakini before he breathed his last. She also told her that the Emperor still  \\x0cremembered her and that there was a half chance that the Emperor might live for some more time if only he could see her once. It was only for that reason that the Chief Minister sent his men to capture her and bring her to the Emperor’s presence. Poonkuzhali also told her in sign language that she stayed in the Chief Minister’s Palace for the night. She further told her that Princess Kunthavai was waiting for the Mute Queen at the Chief Minister’s palace and that she would personally take her to the Emperor. Mandhakini consented to go with them to the Palace. When they reached the gates of the Fort the personal guards of the Emperor, the Velakkara Army, were entering the Fort. Mandhakini and her escorts stepped aside to let the army pass. Mandhakini was looking at the King’s Bodyguards with great curiosity. A big crowd barged into the Fort along with the army of body guards. The soldiers guarding the gates did their best to prevent the entry of those people; but failed. The soldiers even tried to close the gates of the Fort. But they could not do it. They could not do anything. Azhwarkkadian told them - “Let us not go with this crowd. There is a secret underground passage that’ll take us to the Chief Minister’s Palace. Let’s use it.” Poonkuzhali was trying her best to pass on this information to Mandhakini through sign language. But the Mute Queen did not pay heed. She tried to go in along with the crowd. Azhwarkkadian and Poonkuzhali had no option other than to follow her. After entering the Fort, Thirumalai told about the secret passage once again and suggested that they could use that to avoid the unruly crowd. Poonkuzhali tried to communicate to Mandhakini; but she did not listen. She blended with the  \\x0ccrowd. The other two were surprised. The Mute Queen was generally allergic to crowd. What made her to freely mix with the crowd, they wondered. After sometime some people in the crowd started noticing Mandhakini. “Hey, look at this lady! Doesn’t she look like the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur?”  People started to talk among themselves. Poonkuzhali and Azhwarkkadian were concerned. They tried to stop her. Some men noticed Azhwarkkadian and started asking - “Who’s this Vaishnavite? Why is he bothering this lady?”  Some of the King’s bodyguards heard these words. They came back and surrounded the Mute Queen. They pushed other people around her. In the melee Poonkuzhali and Azhwarkkadian were pushed away from Mandhakini. One of the King’s bodyguards spoke to Mandhakini Devi - “Who are you, Devi? Is anyone trying to hurt you? Let us know. We’ll catch culprit and hang him here.”  Mandhakini remained silent. One man saw her and remarked, “Doesn’t she look like the Pazhuvur Queen?”  “Yes, she does. Perhaps she is very proud because of that.”  \\x0c“The entire Pazhuvur crowd is like this woman. An arrogant lot!”  All these things happened near the palace of Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar. A few Pazhuvur soldiers had come there. They heard the derogatory remark about the Pazhuvur crowd. “Who insulted the Pazhuvur people? Let him dare to come to my presence.”  One of the bodyguards went up to him. “Yes. I am the one. What are you going to do?”  “You are arrogant. Your crowd is arrogant. Your pride will be destroyed very soon. Beware!”  “Oh, you are talking like this because you have killed our Prince, right? It’s because of such evil elements like you that we are facing devastating storms. Like the one we had yesterday.” - A man in the crowd burst out. The Pazhuvur soldier sprang on that man. The King’s bodyguard stopped him. Pandemonium prevailed for a while. “Hail the Great Men of Pazhuvur” one group shouted. “Hail Sundara Chozhan, the Emperor of The Three Worlds “another group shouted. “Hail Kodumbalur Velar.”  “Hail Thirukkovalur Malaiyaman.”  Just then the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar arrived on a horse. The clashes stopped. People scattered in all the directions. The body guards went to the front. The soldiers of Pazhuvur surrounded the Junior and told him what happened. Poonkuzhali and Azhwarkkadian were on one side of the street. They were looking for Mandhakini Devi. She was not to be found. “Aiyoo! What is this? Oh My God! How did this happen? What a wonderful Government we have! Tell me how are we going to find my aunt? Will she be hurt? Has she been kidnapped by somebody?” - Poonkuzhali was concerned. As soon as the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar and his soldiers went away they searched for the mute queen. She was not to be found. Azhwarkkadian suggested - “Let me be here for a while. You run to the Chief Minister’s Palace and tell the Minister and the Princess about the developments. We two are not enough to search your aunt. The Minister and the Princess will  \\x0cmake some arrangements.”  Poonkuzhali hesitated. Azhwarkkadian spoke again. “Please listen to me. Your aunt is safe. Nothing would have happened to her. I suspect that she might have seen a known face in the crowd. She was focussing her eyes in one direction. My guess is that she saw somebody known to her. That’s why she came in along with the crowd. I am sure that she is following him. We can definitely find her. But first pass on the news to the Chief Minister.”  Poonkuzhali came running to the Chief Minister’s Palace. Kunthavai was concerned; but the Chief Minister was not. “See, Your Highness. The ghost of mutiny is waiting for a chance to pounce upon us. If only the people knew that Arulmozhivarman is alive, the whole country will be on fire.”  “So long as you are the Chief Minister, that won’t happen! Now let’s talk about my step mother, Minister Sir. It looks like what I feared might happen. Tell me how to find her.”  “Don’t worry about her, Devi. She has come into the Fort. She can’t go out without my knowledge. I’ll make arrangements for that. I’ll also send a search party to look for her. I am sure Mandhakini Devi will not leave our Fort without seeing the Emperor.”  \\x0cChapter 27 - In the Subterranean Treasury  In a way Azhwarkkadian’s guess on the reason for the Mute Queen getting away from them was right. A huge crowd barged into the Fort soon after the Emperor’s bodyguards entered. Mandhakini saw the conspirator, Ravidasan, entering the Fort along with the crowd. As a general rule people who are deprived of the use of one sense organ would have extraordinary sharpness in the other sense organs. Mandhakini could not talk. Nor could she hear. As if to compensate these losses her eye-sight was unusually sharp. Azhwarkkadian and Poonkuzhali focused their attention only on Mandhakini Devi and did not see anybody else. That was the reason Mandhakini could see Ravidasan while the other two did not see him. Mandhakini Devi had a gift of a strong sense of foreboding. She strongly felt in her nerves that Ravidasan had come into the Fort for an evil mission. She remembered Ravidasan’s attempts to kill Prince Arulmozhivarman in Srilanka. When she saw Ravidasan in the streets of Thanjavur her eyes never left him, even for a second. When the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar rode into the crowd, in a confused state the crowd dispersed giving way for him. Precisely at that time Mandhakini saw Ravidasan and another person hurrying into one of the alleys inside the Fort. She ran behind the two men and soon she was in the same alley with them. A minute after this happened, Azhwarkkadian and Poonkuzhali were pushed away by the crowd and for a few seconds they could not keep track of Mandhakini Devi. Later when they looked for her she was not to be found. As soon as Mandhakini entered the alley she turned back a couple of times to check whether Poonkuzhali and Azhwarkkadian were following her. She did not see them. She was clear that her priority now was to follow Ravidasan. Long back when Vandhiya Thevan fled from Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s men he took exactly the same route now taken by Ravidasan and his accomplice, Soman Sambavan, the one who was part of the conspirators’ assembly at the war memorial at Thiruppurambayam. The two men ran through the alleys. They did not mind the trees lying on the way. They just jumped over those fallen trees and the small cesspools of stagnant water. There was a mild breeze which caused the leaves to flutter and the branches to sway gently. They never suspected that somebody could follow them. They never looked back. And even if they did, they would not have noticed Mandhakini Devi who was quite adept in hiding herself from their eyes. Their fast walk ended near the outer wall of the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s palace. An uprooted tree had fallen over the wall. Ravidasan and Soman Sambavan used the tree as a ladder to scale the wall and jump into the palace garden. Mandhakini Devi was keenly observing their actions. She also took the same route. Ravidasan made Soman Sambavan wait in the garden. He then approached the palace of Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar. Both the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar and his queen, Nandini, were not in the palace at that time. The place looked deserted. Ravidasan could however hear the voices of the maids. Two of the maids came to the back yard. They found that many trees in the garden had fallen down. “Our garden now looks like the Asokavan of Ramayana, after it was destroyed by Hanuman.” A maid commented. “You are right. If only our Sita Devi were here now she would have been terribly upset.”  They were chatting for some time and then turned back to go into the Palace. Ravidasan, who was well hidden in the bushes, mimicked the hooting sound of an owl. The maids looked in the direction of the sound. One of the maids said - “Did you hear that? An owl is hooting in the afternoon. I think even the owls have gone crazy after yesterday’s storm.” The other maid remained silent. The two women then went into the palace. After sometime the silent one came back. She reached the gazebo that was sandwiched between the Palace and the underground treasury. It was in this gazebo that Vandhiya Thevan met the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur long back. The maid looked at the garden with a pointed glance. The owl’s hooting was heard again. The maid walked towards the source of the sound. Ravidasan who had been hiding behind a large tree came out to meet her. He stared at the maid with his magnetic eyes. “Oh, Sorcerer, was that you? The Queen is not here. Why did you come now?”  “The Queen sent me here.”  \\x0c“Oh My God! You didn’t leave the Queen in peace even while she was travelling. Why did you come? If only somebody knows.... “  “So what...”  “Don’t be so flippant. The Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar is suspicious of the maids here in this palace. He has warned me. He has issued strict orders - should you ever come here I should report to him immediately.”  “Let him go to hell. Their period is over. Don’t worry. I want the keys of the underground treasury. Please bring them fast.”  “No. I won’t give them to you.”  “See, this is your Queen’s signet ring. I have the required authority.”  “You might have stolen it from her, who knows?”  “How dare you call me a thief? And you do that even after seeing your Queen trembling in fear in my presence. I am going to curse you now. Tonight nine ghosts will come to your bed and carry you to the burial ground and then..... “  “NO! NO! NO! DON’T DO THAT! Let your ghosts be with you. Why should I  \\x0cbother about anything? You showed me the Queen’s signet ring and I am fetching you whatever you need. But don’t be in a hurry. See the garden is in ruins. And the maids of the palace are coming here often to have a look. I’ll bring the keys to you when the girls are eating their dinner. And be patient till then.”  “Agreed. Please bring some food for me as well. It has been two days since I ate. So bring me plenty of food.”  The maid left the place. Ravidasan and Soman Sambavan sat on a fallen tree and were chatting for a long time. Mandhakini Devi was keenly observing their actions. She hid herself from their view and sat a little away from them. She could not understand the conversation between Ravidasan and the maid. But her intuition warned her that something bad was going to happen quite soon. The maid returned after a long time. Ravidasan went to her. He got the keybunch and the food parcel from her. Ravidasan and the girl went to the gazebo and from there they started walking towards the subterranean treasury. The treasury-lock had to be opened with three different keys. The place was absolutely dark. Ravidasan turned to the maid. “Oh My God! I forgot! How can I go in this darkness? Can you bring a light or at least a torch?”  “How can I bring the light or torch at noon? If somebody sees me and suspects my intentions… “  “I don’t know. But do you want me to believe that you are not smart enough to smuggle a light here? If you don’t I’ll send fire-mouthed ghosts to devour you... “  “Will you please shut up? You want a light? I’ll bring it.”  “And before you do that I’ll have my food. I am famished.”  As soon as the maid left for the palace Ravidasan went into the garden along with the food parcel. He gave it to his accomplice Soman Sambavan. “You might have to stay in the Treasury for two or three days. You may have to wait for the right opportunity. Have this food parcel with you. The girl has gone to fetch a light. You need to go into the treasury before she comes back.”  The two men walked towards the treasury. Mandhakini Devi was in hot pursuit. Chapter 28 - The Subterranean Chamber  Ravidasan carefully looked in all the directions. He then pointed out the open door that led to the subterranean chamber to Soman Sambavan. He asked him to go in. “At first you won’t be able to see. It’ll be so dark down there. But don’t stand near the door. Go a little further and stand there till you get used to that darkness.”  No sooner than Soman Sambavan entered the underground passage he was swallowed by the darkness. Ravidasan then walked through the garden path to reach Nandini Devi’s gazebo. He was viewing the Pazhuvettaraiyar’s palace from there. There was a reason. If somebody other than the maid came out he would have to run back to the underground chamber and close the door. While Ravidasan was in the gazebo Mandhakini walked towards the underground chamber without making any noise. The door was still open. She got in. Mandhakini was used to staying in dense forests during night time. The subterranean darkness did not deter her. She was able to regain her vision in a few seconds. She saw Ravidasan’s companion hitting a pillar in the passage. She walked in the opposite direction. She found a flight of steps leading further down. She walked down the steps and stood there. Soman Sambavan must have heard some ruffling noise. “Who is that? Who is that? - He shouted. His voice went through the open door and reached the ears of Ravidasan. At the same time Ravidasan saw the maid walking to him with a burning torch in hand. He ran ahead and cautioned his accomplice. As soon as he entered the passage he spoke out aloud “Sambava, where are you? Did you call me?”  “Yes, I did.”  “Why are you in a hurry? If only somebody outside heard you we’d be finished. Did you think that I’d leave you alone here and go away?”  “No, not at all. I wanted to ask you something.”  Soman Sambavan approached Ravidasan. At this time there was a bright light near the door. “Oh, the maid has come back with a torch. She should not see you at any cost. Go! Go deep inside and hide yourself behind one of the pillars. Quick!”  Soman Sambavan retreated in a hurry. The next second the maid was there at the door along with the burning torch. “Sorcerer, Sorcerer, where are you?”  “Right here.”  Ravidasan approached her and got the torch from her. “Hi girl, lock the door from outside and take back the keys. Come back with the keys after thirty minutes. Knock the door gently. If I respond to your knocking then and only then open the door. Make sure nobody is around when you open the door.”  “Done, Sorcerer. But it is my duty to warn you. Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar has already smelt something fishy. If you are caught by any chance, promise me that you won’t spill my name.”  “Don’t worry, girl. Didn’t I tell you that the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s time is up? He is in his last days.”  “Why do you want me to come again to open the door? Don’t you know about the other exit?”  \\x0c“Yes, I do. But that exit will be useless today. Vettaru River is in floods. Ok, you may go now. And come back exactly after 24 minutes.”  The maid went out. The moment she locked the door from outside Ravidasan locked the door from inside. He then held the torch aloft and went to Soman Sambavan. “Sambava, you wanted to ask me something?”  “Did you come here earlier?”  “I have come here so many times. Whatever gold and treasures we have now came only from here.”  “I didn’t ask that. You left me here and went out. Did you come in again?”  “No. I came just now.”  “Only now? You didn’t come earlier?”  “No, I didn’t. Why do you ask?”  \\x0c“After you went out something blocked the light at the door. I hit a pillar.”  “Perhaps the door might have closed and opened again.”  “It seemed as though a figure walked in. I remember hearing the footsteps.”  “You are hallucinating, Sambava. This underground chamber is like that. At times there will be shadows in darkness. There will be a sudden flash of light which will vanish the very next second. You’ll hear weird sounds. Many people who have come here have died of fear. Their skeletons are scattered around here. Pazhuvettaraiyar has deliberately left the bones here so that anybody who enters the underground treasury by stealth will be scared to death.”  “But is it at all possible to come here by stealth?”  “Normally, no. I don’t think anybody but me has come here in that way. Even I have come here thanks to the Junior Queen and her maid.”  “But then you were talking about the bones and skeletons?”  “If Pazhuvettaraiyar wants to punish anyone he would keep the doors to the treasury slightly open and let the person hover around the area. If the person is tempted by his greed to come in, well, that’s his end. He’d never go back alive. Even his bones will not go out of this place.”  \\x0c“Are you suggesting that but for you no one else who has entered this place by stealth has gone out alive?”  “Earlier I was quite sure of that. But now I have my doubts. Especially about two persons.”  “I know who you are referring to. Vandhiya Thevan and Kandhanmaran. Right?”  “Yes.”  “We should have killed these people. Why are we still letting them live?”  “How many times should I have to tell you? The Junior Queen has spared Vandhiya Thevan for a very important task. When Sundara Chozhan’s clan is destroyed completely Vandhiya Thevan will also die. The time has come. “  ““  “Come; let me show you the secret passages around here. You will have to be careful about one thing. There is a Mandapam here which contains all the precious stones and gems. These were collected by the Chozha Kings over hundreds of years and are now lying in heaps. They are priceless. If you are tempted by them you’ll forget your mission.”  \\x0c“Ravidasa, do you know who are you talking to? I have also sworn on the headless body of our King Veerapandiyan as you did.”  “Who denied that? When I saw those heaps of priceless gems and pearls, I too was a little distracted. That’s why I am warning you. Come let’s go. First I’ll show you the way to the King’s Palace from here. You go around the place and familiarize yourself with the surroundings after I leave. It might come handy some day.”  Ravidasan held the torch aloft and walked ahead. Soman Sambavan walked along. They went on the same way which the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar and Nandini had used some time ago. In the smoky illumination provided by the burning torch the pillars and their shadows appeared like large black ghosts. The bats that lived in that darkness seemed like little spirits let loose. There were huge spider-webs in many places occupied by giant spiders. On the ground there were many strange creatures that crawled - some fast and some pretty slow. As Ravidasan had predicted they could hear many weird sounds. The storm raging outside echoed inside the subterranean chambers. Soman Sambavan froze. “Ravidasa, do you hear the sound of footsteps?”  “Why not? I do hear the sound of our footsteps. Now is the time to be fearless. Don’t get scared by the sounds and sights. You are shivering in fear even while I am here with you. How are you going to be here all alone for two, three days?”  \\x0c“No, I am not afraid. Instead of indulging in pointless hallucination after you have gone, I want to clarify certain things with you. Didn’t you say that those who entered this chamber died here?”  “Yes, I did. And their ghosts would be hovering around here. So what? The ghosts will be scared of us. That little boy, Vandhiya Thevan, had been here and he escaped from this place unhurt. You and I have seen a million ghosts. Why should we be afraid?”  “I am not worried about the spirits and ghosts. I am worried about the other creatures... the venomous ones... snakes... scorpions... and others... “  “Are you saying that you are afraid of snakes and scorpions? The moment they see us they’ll run to their holes.”  “Even then to stay here for two, three days... I am a little worried, Ravidasa. If I get an opportunity a little earlier... “  “No, No. Don’t do that. Never ever commit that blunder. Today is Tuesday. You’ll have to wait for Wednesday and Thursday. And during these two days find out the time when Sundara Chozhan is alone. His Queen will always be by his side. She will go to Durga Parameswari Temple on Friday. You’ll have to finish your work on Friday night. Sundara Chozhan’s clan will be destroyed without a trace on Friday. Any change in the plan might spoil our mission and endanger our lives too.”  \\x0cThe men continued to walk fast. Soman Sambavan was a bit restless. He was looking around as he walked. But the two men could not see Mandhakini who was following them closely, hiding behind the pillars at times and silently leaping forward at times to ensure that they were in her sight. They reached the other side of the subterranean chamber. There was a high wall before them. There were no windows, doors or other entrances through the wall. But at the top of the wall there was a small latticed window through which some light entered the chamber. Ravidasan gave the torch to Sambavan. He started scaling the high-rise wall holding on to the crevices and protrusions. He reached the latticed window and spent some time seeing through it. Then he scaled down the wall. “Do you want me to jump out through that latticed window? Is that the only way to reach the target?”  “No, not at all. Only rats can get through that aperture. But if you see through that window you’ll have a glimpse of the Chozha King’s Palace. And you can also see the most important place in the Palace.”  “You mean Sundara Chozhan’s bedroom?”  “Yes. You can watch the people’s moments there through this latticed window. Now come with me. And observe what I do.”  \\x0cRavidasan bent down his head to examine something on the floor. He placed his foot on a round stone pressing it hard and while remaining in that position he gripped a square-shaped stone with both his hands and pushed it hard. A passage appeared below. “Oh My God! A secret passage within the underground chamber!”  “You are right. No one else but the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar and his Junior Queen know about this passage. I am the third person to know. You are the fourth. Did you see how I opened the entrance?”  Sambavan nodded. The two men went down through that secret passage. The light from the torch disappeared. The Mute Queen came out of her hiding place and in one giant leap reached the entrance of the secret passage. She looked at the passage for some time. She placed her foot down to get in. At the last minute she changed her mind. She thought for a while. She then looked at the place where Ravidasan scaled the high wall. She leapt to that place and scaled the wall in the same way Ravidasan did. She reached the latticed window and sat on the place near it. She looked through the window. There was a garden adjacent to the wall. And beyond the garden was a beautiful  \\x0cmansion. She had goose bumps when she saw the magnificent building. Her intuition told her that somebody dearer to her than her own life lived there. She also understood that the culprits using the secret passage had the motive of hurting her dear one. She prayed to that Being of Love residing inside the depths of her heart that she should be blessed with the skill and strength to foil the attempts of those bloody villains. As she was about to get down from that vantage point she looked at the balcony of the beautiful mansion. She was shocked by what she saw there. Ravidasan and Soman Sambavan were in the balcony hiding behind the pillars. It was daytime and hence she could see the balcony clearly. Ravidasan no longer held the torch. Sambavan was armed with a deadly spear. Ravidasan got the spear from him and aimed at a spot inside the mansion. Mandhakini’s heart skipped a beat. Thank God, he did not throw the spear. He just mimicked the action. Then he returned the spear to Sambavan. The two men disappeared from that place. Mandhakini climbed down the wall. She hid herself never taking her eyes off the entrance to the secret passage. A little later she could see the light of the torch from there. The two men came out and closed the secret passage. “Do you know how to open the entrance?”  “Yes, I do. Don’t worry. I’ll honour my commitment. Sundara Chozhan’s life will be over by this Friday. You complete your part of the mission.”  “The Junior Queen will take care of Karikalan. We need not have to worry about  \\x0chim. The little tiger has escaped from the sea and looks like it’s in Nagapattinam. But this time he can’t escape. The two women devils that saved him are right now in Thanjavur. I saw the boat-girl and the dumb bitch in the crowd that barged into the Fort. That Vaishnava Fanatic is also here. So there is nobody to save that little tiger, I mean Prince Arulmozhivarman. I am sending an assassin to Nagapattinam. By this Friday the entire clan of Sundara Chozhan will be destroyed.”  “What about Madhuranthakan?”  “Poor fellow! Let him live for some time. It is better that a fool like him occupies the Chozha throne till our Emperor comes of age.”  Ravidasan and Soman Sambavan traced back their steps to the entrance of the subterranean chamber. Chapter 29 - The King’s Dharshan  After the two conspirators disappeared, Mandhakini came to the entrance of secret passage. She carefully observed the spot. She then made an attempt to open the secret door but could not. When Ravidasan opened the door she was too far from him to notice how he opened the door. She knew in her guts that at least one of the men would return to that spot sooner or later. So she decided to wait there. She was not disappointed, for Soman Sambavan returned to that spot after seeing off Ravidasan. He had a torch in his hand. But the light was very faint now. Soman Sambavan was bragging about his courage in the presence of Ravidasan. Left alone his heart was gripped by a vague fear which was quite evident in the way he looked around. He sat near the entrance to the secret passage. He was scared. After a few minutes the torch went off. He then started to glance at the latticed window which was the only source of light. The light coming through the window was gradually getting weaker and weaker. Once he was sure that the light had completely gone and that the sun had set for the day, he tried to open the door to the secret passage. Mandhakini was now standing very close to Soman Sambavan. He had pressed the right levers and the door opened. He was about to get in. It was precisely at that time that he heard a long scream very close by. Soman Sambavan had witnessed many scary sights in his life. He had heard many strange sounds. But never in the past had he heard such a strange voice, which  \\x0che was sure, did not belong to any living human being. If at all there was something called a ghost and if at all it had a voice it would be exactly like the sound he heard just now. When he heard that strange sound for the first time he hesitated. He waited for the echo to fade completely. But when he heard the same sound for the second time, the hairs on his body stood straight. When he heard the same sound for the third time, his courage evaporated and all his strength vanished. He was in the grip of fear and started to run blindly in that dark chamber. As soon as he disappeared, Mandhakini stepped into that secret passage. After a few steps down she hit level ground. She walked so fast that even if Soman Sambavan had seen her getting in and came running behind her he could not have caught her. For a moment it appeared that the way led to hell; for it was dark and endless. Finally the path did end at one point in front of a high rise wall. She could see a gap on the top. She could feel the presence of steps with her hand. As she tried to climb those steps something hit her head. Between the steps of the secret passage and the place which hit her head there were some openings large enough to let her in. She entered one of them and came out on the other side. She could see gigantic figures in the place. Mandhakini was familiar with the giant-sized statues in the Lankan Island. So she was not shocked by what she saw. She carefully noted down the place where the path ended. There were many giant-sized statues there. The ten-headed demon king Ravana was trying to uproot Kailash Mountain, the abode of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathi. The divine couple was seated atop the hill. The place where Ravana had lifted the hill had become a valley. His twenty hands bore the weight of the mountain. Mandhakini saw through the gap between the two hands of the Demon King. She now knew that she had entered the Hall of Sculptures of the Chozha Palace. Nobody would have noticed that there was a path beneath the huge statue of Kailash Hill. Nobody would have thought of exploring that path. It was a perfect hiding place. Mandhakini spent a few hours marvelling at the secret passage that was hidden beneath a statue in the Hall of Sculptures. Then she went around the hall. There was not much light there. But because Mandhakini was used to moving in forests in dim light she could see everything very clearly. At one place there was a statue depicting the Chozha Emperor Sibi giving a piece of his flesh to save a dove that was being chased by a vulture. Chozhas were given the epithet Sembian because they were descendants of the great Emperor Sibi. The Mute Queen spent some time looking deeply at the sculpture and then moved away. Another sculpture showed the perennial Ganges River flowing from the head of Lord Shiva. Bhageerathan was standing by the side reverentially folding his hands towards the Lord. The river first known as Bhageerathi flowed into the mouth of a gigantic Rishi and then flowed out through his ears. A short Rishi was taking water from the Ganges in his kettle. That Rishi must be Sage Agasthya. He emptied the contents of his kettle on another mountain. The river that flowed from the kettle got bigger and bigger as it came down. That was River Cauvery. They must have made arrangements for water to flow when the sculpture was originally installed there. But there was no water now. River Cauvery became long, turned at several points and passed through mountains and large gardens full of dense trees. There were a lot of temples of Lord Shiva on the either side of the river. At the point where River Cauvery fell in the sea the Hall of Sculptures ended in a wall. Mandhakini placed her hand on the wall and pressed. A small door opened. She came out through the door and landed in the Royal garden. The Palace towers and balconies appeared close by. Mandhakini looked around. It was late in the evening. The lights were fading. There was nobody in the Royal garden. There were many fallen trees in the garden as there were in Pazhuvettaraiyar’s palace. Even if somebody had been there in the garden they would not have seen her getting out of the Hall of Sculptures. Mandhaki stood near the Hall of Sculptures waiting for darkness to set in. There was a likelihood of that Devil armed with a spear coming at that time. She was looking into the Hall of Sculptures every now and then. The lamps in the castle came to life one by one. In a few minutes the palace was bathed in the light of oil lamps. The light from the lamps in the lower chambers escaped the palace buildings through the windows. The lamps in the terrace competed with the stars. Oh My God! The night looks more dangerous than the day, thought Mandhakini. She carefully scanned all the directions with her sharp eyes. She discovered that there were not many lamps in the part of the palace that was adjacent to the Hall of Sculptures. She remembered the place. It was exactly in this place where the villain who tried to kill her dear one, Ponniyin Selvan, (the one she personally saved from River Cauvery), had stood a little while ago along with his accomplice. It was in this place that Ravidasan got the spear from the other person and took an aim as if he were going to throw it on somebody. There were not many lamps in this area. What could probably be the reason, she thought. But right now the lack of lamps provided her a cover of darkness. As soon as the sun set completely and the Royal garden was enveloped in a sheet of darkness, Mandhakini ran towards the Palace as fast as a frightened deer. She reached the Palace building in a matter of seconds. That part of the Palace had a lot of round enclosures covered in sloping roofs. The sloping roofs were supported by an array of pillars. At several places there were steps that led to the upper chambers of the Palace. In those enclosures she could find large copper vessels normally used to cook feasts for a large number of people. There were also many old ivory palanquins and discarded thrones. Mandhakini glanced at those objects for a while. Finally Mandhakini got enough courage to climb a flight of stairs. There were round enclosures at the first floor as well. But the pillars that supported the roofs in the first floor had a lot of artwork on them. The windows were artistic too. There were a lot of marble benches on which the members of the Royal household probably sat to enjoy the moon-lit nights. Mandhakini went around the seemingly deserted rooms and verandas in the terrace. She was afraid to go to the interior portion of the terrace. She saw light at one place. She hid herself behind a pillar and looked on. OH MY GOD! She saw something from which she could not take off her eyes. In a large enclosure there was a huge cot which had a lot of art work on it. A person was lying on the bed. There were four women and two men standing around the man. Mandhakini could infer from her hiding place that the people standing were devoted to the person lying down. A little away stood two maids who were even more reverential. There was only one lamp in that enclosure. And that was fixed in a niche near the bed. The light was faint. Mandhakini saw those standing around the cot. One of them was a person who was dearer to her than her own life - her brother’s daughter, Poonkuzhali. She had seen others earlier albeit from a distance. But she did not remember or recognise them now. Mandhakini hesitantly moved her eyes to the person lying in the cot. Her heart stopped. Yes. He was the one. He was the one who stole her life and her heart when she was a little girl. But that happened several aeons ago. He was the one whom she had met in the Ghost Island when she was a little girl roaming around the forest without any care in the world. Yes, He was the one who had converted the Ghost Island into a heaven for some time. Yes, he was the one forcibly taken away from her by those people who came in large numbers in a large ship. Oh My God! How time has changed him! All those events happened so long ago that Mandhakini thought they must have happened in her past life. Yes, she had seen him several times after that, every time without his knowing about it. When he went on the luxury boats in River Cauvery she had hidden herself behind the bushes and had seen him. When he went on the streets in the golden chariot drawn by pedigree white steeds imported from Arabia she was in the crowd cheering him. But she had not seen him recently. But my God! Why has he changed so much in so short a time? Why has he aged so much so fast? He now sported a moustache and a beard. There was no flesh on his cheeks. The skin had gone dry. There were wrinkles on his forehead. Oh My God, what happened to the magnetic light which used to glow in his beautiful eyes? Do men change so much in so short a time? Mandhakini had seen many people in the Lankan Island who were afflicted with the poisonous fever and who were about to die. And this man closely resembled those people. Oh My God! His face which used to shine like a golden sun has completely lost its sheen. Perhaps his end is near. Mandhakini suddenly remembered the scene that she witnessed a few hours ago. Ravidasan and his accomplice were standing at the place where she was standing now. It was from this place did they take an aim with a spear. Oh My God! Did they aim at the person lying in the cot? The mere thought made her body shudder. She was losing her balance. She felt like fainting. She held the pillar nearby with all her might to avoid a fall. Chapter 30 - The Charge  The Emperor was in a very bad state. He was shattered –in mind and body. Prince Kunthavai had told the Chief Minister that the Emperor did not have even a wink of sleep on the night of the storm. It was not an exaggeration. Even during the day his mind was in a mess. Later in the afternoon the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar came to see him. And his words only served to aggravate the Emperor’s agony. Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar charged the Chief Minister of several offences. Ever since the Chief Minister came to the capital the security arrangements at the Fort were lax. Quite a lot of people now entered the Fort on the pretext of seeing the Chief Minister. This might compromise on the security of even the Emperor, he cautioned. Of course the Emperor brushed these charges with a smile. He did not consider them worthy of investigation. But the Emperor could not brush aside the further charges levelled against the Chief Minister. The Junior told the King that on that day there was a scuffle between the King’s Bodyguards, the Velakkara Army and the people who came from outside. He said that heated words were exchanged between the bodyguards and the people and the situation could have worsened into a civil disturbance. But fortunately the Junior crossed the place at that time and a major clash was averted. The Junior also said that he talked to both sides and made sure that the warring factions went away in peace. The next charge against the Chief Minister was graver still. The Chief Minister was known throughout the country as a man of high morals. But, the Junior complained, his conduct during the last few days was not worthy of his name or stature. The Chief Minister had forcibly abducted a woman from Kodikkarai and had brought her to the capital. And that he used the palanquin and the men of Pazhuvur Palace for the shameful act. The Junior told the King that he could not refuse a request coming from the Chief Minister and that he instantly obliged him with the men and the palanquin from the Pazhuvur Palace. And now that the Minister had used them for a dishonourable purpose the shame would be on the Pazhuvur clan, he argued. The final charge centred on a suspicious occurrence. “I was worried because a Sorcerer was visiting my brother’s palace quite often. As the Sorcerer was coming at the instance of the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur I could not directly take any action against the suspicious visitor. \"Nevertheless I appointed a spy to keep a watch on the movements near my brother’s palace. The spy reported to me today that somebody jumped the wall of the Chancellor’s Palace. \"I sent more men to apprehend the trespasser. My men caught the offender. And it turned out to be none other than Azhwarkkadian, the darling disciple of our Honourable Chief Minister. “Why did you scale the wall?” - I asked him. He refused to reply. He also said that he was acting on the orders of the Chief Minister. If the Chief Minister stoops to this level... well, how can I handle the security of Thanjavur Fort.? “  \"As my brother is not in town I had to trouble you with this information.”  The Emperor’s agony worsened. “Leave it to me. Aniruddhar is coming to see me this evening. I’ll ask him to explain his actions. I am deeply hurt by his act of abducting a woman from Kodikkarai. Are you sure it’s true? Have you checked?”  “I have absolutely no doubts, Your Majesty. The palanquin bearers and the soldiers who accompanied them are the direct eye-witnesses to what happened. They reported everything to me yesterday midnight. \"According to their account they were caught in the storm as they were approaching the Thanjavur Fort. A tree had fallen down and it appears some were crushed by it. They were relieved to find that the tree did not fall on the palanquin. \"Thank God we are not guilty of killing an innocent woman. Your Majesty should hold an enquiry on this incident. And Your Majesty should also enquire Azhwarkkadian.”  The Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar took leave of the Emperor. He did not want to be there when the Chief Minister came to see the King. He had his own fears. The Minister might pose some embarrassing questions to him. More importantly if the Chief Minister got the Emperor’s sanction to open the Royal Treasury for Flood Relief it would be a greater problem. Then he would not be able to face his brother. The Emperor was expecting Aniruddha Brahmarayar right from the morning. But the Minister came only in the evening when the sun was about to set. The Minister, generally a strong person, appeared shaken that day. Even though he had planned his actions meticulously to the last detail it had backfired. He thought he would have some news about Mandhakini and then he could meet the Emperor. That was the reason he had been postponing the meeting till it was very late. And Azhwarkkadian brought more bad news. He reported that he went to the alley where he suspected the Mute Queen would have probably gone. And he reported seeing a lady jumping Pazhuvettaraiyar’s wall. And he was sure that it was Mandhakini. Before he could look for the lady he was apprehended by the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s men. “Master, I could not tell the real reason to them. I had to use your name to free myself.” - Azhwarkkadian said. This made him even more anxious. “There are so many palaces inside the Fort. Why should she choose the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s Palace? I can’t even openly search the place. But let’s see. In a way it’s better that the Senior is not in town at the moment. \"I’ll place my men around the Palace. I have my man inside the Palace as well. I’ll send word to him to keep an eye for the lady. But this boat-girl has caused so much of embarrassment for me.”  “Master, even if the boat-girl had not intervened, there is no guarantee that Mandhakini Devi would have acted in the manner you liked. She would have  \\x0ctried to run away.”  “But I have hopes. Having come thus far she would not go back without seeing the Emperor. Let’s try, Thirumalai. But it won’t be fair to delay my meeting with the Emperor any further. I want you and that boat-girl to accompany me. \"We should tell the Emperor whatever we know about the Prince. If the boat-girl who actually rescued the Prince and rowed him to safety told the story herself the Emperor will be convinced.”  Chief Minister Aniruddha Brahmarayar, his disciple Azhwarkkadian and Poonkuzhali walked into the Palace late in the evening. Princess Kunthavai and Vanathi were waiting for them at the entrance of the Palace. Kunthavai was disturbed by the fact that Mandhakini Devi could not be traced. She was even more disturbed on knowing that the Mute Queen had trespassed into the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar’s garden. She was worried over the possible disastrous consequences this may entail. “Minister Sir, I hear that there is an underground exit from the Pazhuvur Palace. What if the lady escapes by that route?”  The Minister was reminded of Vandhiya Thevan. “Devi, it is not that easy to find out that exit. Not everyone will be as lucky as Vandhiya Thevan. But I have not ruled out that possibility. I have placed my men outside the Fort as well.”  He then went into the Emperor’s bed chamber leaving Poonkuzhali and Azhwarkkadian with Kunthavai. The Minister paid his respects to the Emperor and Queen Vanamaadevi. He then explained the reasons for his delay. He was busy in assessing the damages caused by the recent floods and organising relief work. The Emperor was a little pacified on knowing about the relief work. “It’s good you were here in the absence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. But what is this I hear? Did you forcibly abduct any woman from Kodikkarai? The Commander of the Fort, Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar told me a little while ago. \"My dear Brahmarayar, I never expected this kind of a conduct from you. There might be a very strong reason for doing that. \"In that case you should have informed me upfront. Or perhaps you all think that you need not share any information with me because I am ill, because I am an invalid lying on my bed all day doing nothing? \"Kunthavai tells me that Arulmozhivarman did not drown and that he is safe at the Buddhist Monastery in Nagapattinam. I don’t know whether I should be happy or sad. If he is alive why hasn’t he come to see me till now? Why nobody has told me that he is alive till now? \"Minister, I am afraid that so many things are happening around me and I am kept in the dark. So many things are happening in my kingdom. I am wondering why I should continue to live......”  The Emperor choked. There were tears in his eyes. The Chief Minister maintained silence because he did not want to interrupt the Emperor. He broke his silence with forceful words. “Stop it, My Lord. Please stop talking like this. We have been friends for forty years, my Lord. And during these forty years I have not done anything against your interests. And I won’t do in future as well. \"Yes, I kept a few matters to myself with the good intention of not disturbing you when you are ill. That was out of my love and respect for you. \"If you think I have wronged you, please forgive me, Your Majesty. And now I’ll answer all your questions. I request you to please listen to me.”  “Chief Minister, I don’t think I’ll be peaceful in this birth. I am not sure whether I’d get that eluding peace in my next birth too. When my children and my dearest friend and Chief Minister are engaged in a conspiracy against me.... “  “My Lord, you’ll soon know who are conspiring against you. I am not part of that conspiracy gang. I am retaining the Minister post only in name. I have told you several times that I’ll hand over the Minister post to the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar. Even now I am ready, Your Majesty. I’ll give my post to him and walk out empty handed even if you have the slightest doubt on my loyalty… “  “Yes, Minister. You are always ready to desert me at the slightest provocation. The only person who is going to be with me till I breathe my last is this woman, my wife, the Malaiyaman’s daughter. \"I have committed a lot of sins; but I must have done some good deeds on the side. For otherwise, I would not have got this angel as my wife in this life.”  Vanamaadevi heard these words and broke into a sob. She then ran out of the room. “Oh, King of Kings, whatever you said about your wife is true. And your children born of her divine womb are all fiercely devoted to you.”  \\x0c“But they don’t respect my words, Minister. They don’t obey my orders. They do whatever they like to do. And you are always on their side. \"You knew from the beginning that Arulmozhivarman is alive and that he is in the Buddhist Monastery at Nagapattinam. Why didn’t you tell me earlier?”  “Please forgive me, My Lord. I was not sure of that till yesterday. I was sure of one thing though - that the Prince would be blessed with long life. The astrologers were quite unanimous when they cast the Prince’s horoscope at the time of his birth - that he’d live long and attain glorious heights in life. I never thought that those predictions would become false.”  “Chief Minister, there is no limit to the havoc wrought by astrology and astrologers. I am thinking of sending all the astrologers into exile. \"Some people have placed a heavy reliance on the astrological predictions concerning Arulmozhi and want to crown him as the King even while I am alive. Aren’t you one of them, Minister?”  “I promise I am not, my Lord. On the other hand I thought that it would be better if the Prince doesn’t enter the Kingdom for some time. When I went to Srilanka I told my views to the Prince himself. \"As soon as I left Lanka, Pazhuvettaraiyar’s men came to Lanka to apprehend the Prince. And Your Majesty, it has happened with your full blessings. \"This news has spread throughout the country. And the people are quite furious with the Pazhuvettaraiyars. In fact the rumour is that that the Pazhuvettaraiyars sunk the Prince’s ship and drowned him in the sea.”  “Lie, Minister. It’s absolute falsehood. Parthibendran has told everything to me. The Prince did not come in the ship sent by the Pazhuvettaraiyar brothers. \"He came in Parthibendran’s ship. And the Prince, of his own accord, wantonly jumped into the sea. And he did that to save somebody else from another burning ship. And he jumped in spite of Parthibendran strongly advising against that rash act. \"Now when I think of it I know everything is a lie. And they were all fabricated mainly to deceive me. When I think that Princess Kunthavai too is a part of this conspiracy....  \"I couldn’t bear that, Minister. I never could bear that kind of a treachery from my darling daughter, who is dearer to me than my own life. Even if the whole world goes against me I thought Kunthavai would be on my side. And I shared with her something which no father would share with his daughter.”  “Oh, King of Kings, even if the whole world accuses Kunthavai of conspiring against you, I won’t believe that. You shouldn’t believe that either. If the Princess holds back something from you then she should have a strong reason for that. \"It’s a fact that the Prince jumped in the sea to save his friend. The boat-girl who rescued both the Prince and his friend and then rowed them to the shore is waiting in the ante-room. She was an eye-witness to what happened in Srilanka. Shall I call her, Your Majesty?”  “Oh! Call her right now, Chief Minister. Was she the one you abducted from Kodikkarai?”  “Yes, My Lord. I’ll call her now.”  The Chief Minister clapped his hands. Azhwarkkadian and Poonkuzhali entered the Emperor’s bed chamber. Chapter 31 - The Evening Dream  The Emperor looked pointedly at Poonkuzhali. “I don’t think I have seen this girl earlier. But her face looks very familiar. Brahmarayar, who’s she?”  “She is Poonkuzhali, daughter of Thiagavidangar of Kodikkarai.”  “Oh, now I understand.”  And then spoke in a whisper to himself. ‘Yes, she resembles her aunt. She reminds me of her. But there are a lot of differences.’  Poonkuzhali heard the words spoken by the Emperor, even those he whispered to himself. She had not seen him so far. She had heard that the Emperor was more handsome than even the God of Love. The person who had begotten such a handsome Prince had to be like that, thought Poonkuzhali. But what was she seeing today? She saw the Emperor’s form - the one which was laid waste by disease and stress inherent in a King’s life. She was shocked. She had come there to fight with the Emperor. Now she was ashamed that she entertained hostile thoughts towards this shattered old man. Fear, a sense of awe and above all a sense of shyness overwhelmed her so much that she forgot to pay her respects to the monarch. “Hey Girl, how is your father, Thiagavidangar? Is he doing fine?”  The Emperor affectionately enquired. Poonkuzhali was jolted to the present. She then remembered that she was standing in the presence of an Emperor who was wielding sovereignty over a vast area that extended from Srilanka in the South to River Krishna in the North. She prostrated before Sundara Chozhan. She stood up and folded her hands reverentially towards him. Meanwhile the Emperor voiced his doubts to the Chief Minister. “Can this girl talk? Or is she also dumb like her aunt?”  The King’s face shrunk in unbearable agony when he posed the question  “She can talk, Your Majesty. She can talk what nine women can talk at a time. She is still reeling under the shock of seeing you in person.”  “I don’t know why everybody becomes silent on seeing me. Nobody shares anything with me these days.”  The Emperor turned his attention to Poonkuzhali again. “Girl, The Chief Minister tells me that you saved Prince Arulmozhivarman from drowning. Is it true?”  Poonkuzhali hesitated and spoke in a barely audible whisper. “Yes, my Lord. If it is.... an offence..... .”  The Emperor laughed. Given his condition the laugh sounded quite hysterical. “Brahmarayar, did you hear her? ‘If it is an offence... ’ She has saved the Prince and says, ‘if it is an offence... ’ Looks like I want to see my son drowned. Somebody has told this girl that I am such a heartless demon. Chief Minister, do the people of this country think of me in the same way?”  “My Lord, please ignore her words. She is in the grip of fear. Hey Girl, the whole Chozha country is indebted to you for saving the Prince. The Emperor is pleased beyond words. You can name your reward and get that from us at the right time. Now tell the Emperor what happened on that eventful day. You need not have any fear in your mind.”  “Let this girl tell this first. She says that she saved the Prince from the sea. But how did she know that it was the Prince? Has she seen him earlier?” - The Emperor asked. “Yes, my Lord. I have seen the Prince when he boarded the ship to Lanka along with the army. Once the Prince called me “Samudra Kumari””  \\x0c“Aha! The girl has regained her powers of speech!” - The Emperor was sarcastic. Then on being questioned by the Chief Minister Poonkuzhali recounted everything from the time she took Vandhiya Thevan in her boat to Srilanka till she dropped the Prince at Nagapattinam. But the Chief Minister had already warned her not to breathe anything about Mandhakini. The Emperor was pleased. “Girl, what you have done to this country and the Chozha clan is quite invaluable. I am afraid I cannot compensate you enough for your efforts. But I have a question. You rescued the Prince and brought him to our shores. Then why didn’t you bring him here? Why did you take him to Nagapattinam?”  “My Lord, the Prince had a terrible fever. He was delirious. We knew that there are good doctors at the Buddhist Monastery at Nagapattinam. Hence we took him there. We also knew that the monks there worship the Prince. Again given the Prince’s condition at that time, he could travel only by boat and not on a horse-back or a chariot. That way Nagapattinam was the ideal destination.”  “Didn’t you know that Pazhuvettaraiyar was camping at Kodikkarai at that time? Why didn’t you tell him?”  Poonkuzhali hesitated only for a fraction of a second. Then she replied in a fearless voice. “Your Majesty, the whole country knows that Pazhuvettaraiyar has been working against the interests of the Prince. How can I entrust a sick Prince to his avowed enemy?”  “You are right. Pazhuvettaraiyars are my sons’ enemies. Not only them, even I am their enemy. That’s how the whole world thinks. Chief Minister, the storm we had here yesterday night should have been even more severe in the coastal town of Nagapattinam. I am afraid that the Prince might be in danger.”  “My Lord, ours is a blessed country. And we are in the best of our times. Hence... “  “Yes, the Chozha Kingdom is blessed. But I am cursed. Chief Minister, I want to see my sons at least once before I die.”  “Please don’t utter such words, Your Majesty. Who else in this word is blessed the way you are? You are blessed with good children, my Lord. I’ll send my men to Nagapattinam to bring back the Prince safely to the Capital. I will also send my disciple Thirumalai for the purpose.”  Only then did the Emperor cast his glance on Azhwarkkadian. “Oh, he too is here! The Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar was complaining about him. Didn’t he jump the wall of the Pazhuvur Palace?”  \\x0c“He has a good reason, my Lord. Permit me to explain everything tomorrow. You are already exhausted, Your Majesty.”  The Empress, Princess Kunthavai and Vanathi entered the chamber at that time. The Empress spoke to the Chief Minister. “Minister, let’s stop with this for the day. The Doctors are particular that the Emperor should not strain himself.”  The Queen knew what the Emperor needed at that moment. She spoke to the Chief Minister again. “I hear that this girl has a beautiful voice. Ask her to sing a song from Thevaram. The Emperor loves music.”  “As you please, Devi. I’ll also ask my disciple to sing some composition of Azhwars. He too sings very well, Devi.”  Poonkuzhali sang a composition by Saint Thirunavukkarasar. Once the Saint was suffering from a killer disease. He was passionately pleading to the Lord, ‘You haven’t removed this disease yet, my Lord. And the disease is like the Lord of Death constantly tormenting me.’  \\x0cThen Azhwarkkadian sang a pasuram from the Azhwars. One of the Azhwars, on having a vision of the Lord, tells in that song how he saw the Lord’s consort, the Holy Mother, then the Lord’s golden form and goes on to describe his glorious vision. The Emperor closed his eyes as soon as the singing started. Minutes later his troubled face glowed in peace. His breathing was now soft and regular. It was clear that the Emperor had lapsed into a deep sleep. The lights were fading outside. A maid lit a lamp inside the chamber. Everybody left the room. The Empress lingered for a while looking at the sleeping form of the Emperor. Princess Kunthavai who was in the adjacent room signalled to her mother. The Queen walked out of the room. But for the rhythmic breathing coming from the Emperor the room was absolutely silent. The Emperor had not slept the previous night. The songs sung by Poonkuzhali and Azhwarkkadian were quite soothing to his distressed mind. That made the sick Emperor to fall asleep. But his was not a deep sleep. Old memories, new memories, real life incidents and imagined incidents manifested as dreams. The Emperor was on the boat with Poonkuzhali as his companion. Poonkuzhali was singing in tune with the majestic sound coming from the deep sea. Oh mind, don’t lose hopes  \\x0cYour dreams will come true one day A long, dark, stormy night Is followed by a bright day The world comes to life The lotus shivers in happiness The beetles are ecstatic And the sun rises in the East. Sundara Chozhan was ecstatic on hearing this song. All his tiredness was gone. He was happy and refreshed. He was urging Poonkuzhali to sing more. The boat was floating steadily in the deep sea. Suddenly a cloud of darkness enveloped them. There were strong winds. There were waves which resembled moving mountains. The boat which was gently rocking like a cradle now touched the skies one moment and fell down to the depths of the ocean, the very next. The sails of the boat were shattered by the winds. Somehow the boat managed to stay afloat. The Emperor was awe-struck by the way Poonkuzhali managed to steer the boat during the storm. Suddenly the winds stopped. The sea calmed down. The waves died down. There were signs of sun-rise in the Eastern horizon. Soon the sun rose like a golden ball of fire. The sea shone like liquid gold in the  \\x0crays of the morning sun. There were islands full of green coconut groves at a distance. The birds in those islands sang in a sweet voice. The Emperor knew that those islands were near the Lankan shores. It was in one of those islands that he met Mandhakini in one of his past births. The Emperor spoke to Poonkuzhali without taking his eyes off those beautiful islands -  “Poonkuzhali at last you’ve taken me to heaven. How am I going to thank you, dear?”  Poonkuzhali did not respond. The Emperor looked at her again. He was stunned. Because it was not Poonkuzhali. It was his dear Mandhakini. Mandhakini had not changed during the past thirty years. The Emperor did not know what to do. Then he gathered courage to talk to his lady love. “Mandhakini, is that you? Is that really you? Did you come in the form of Poonkuzhali to take me here?”  \\x0cThen he remembered that Mandhakini could not hear him. He looked at her face. She must have understood him by watching his lip moments. There was a smile on her face. The Emperor tried to stand up to go near his lady love. But he could not get up. Only then he remembered that his legs had become useless long ago. “Mandhakini, I’ve become sick. I can’t come to you. You should come to me. Listen, Mandhakini. Even If somebody comes here with an offer to make me the King of the Three Worlds, I won’t leave you. I’d ask them to go to hell. Let’s not go to these islands near Lanka. Somebody will be disturbing us there every now and then. Steer the boat away from these islands. Let’s cross the seven seas and reach the island at the end of the world. Nobody can disturb our peace there.”  Mandhakini smiled as if she understood his words. The scene shifted. Emperor Sundara Chozhan, his Queen and his children were having a joy ride in River Cauvery. They were on a boat which was designed to look like Raja Hams, the celestial bird. The country’s finest musicians were entertaining the King. The Emperor was enjoying the music. His eyes were closed. He was jolted by a scream coming from the other side of the boat. “Oh My God! WHERE IS THE CHILD? MY GOD, WHERE IS PRINCE  \\x0cARULMOZHI?”  The Emperor opened his eyes. He looked around. A woman was holding his darling son, Arulmozhi. The woman was virtually standing on water. And she was trying to drown the Prince. The Emperor could not contain his fury. He was about to jump into the river when he saw the face of the woman. He recognised the evil face of Mandhakini. The recognition paralyzed him. He fell down on the boat with a loud thud. The sudden fall woke him up from the horrible dream. He could not sleep any longer. The bed-chamber was very cool, thanks to the rain and the storm. And yet the Emperor was bathed in sweat. He was a tad relieved when he realized that whatever happened till then was just a dream. He looked in front of him. There was nobody in the room. An oil lamp lighted the room. He thought that others would have left the room because he was sleeping. He first thought of clapping his hands to call them back. Then he decided against it. Let me wait for some time. Let me recover from the shock of my evening dream. He heard a faint sound coming from the terrace. What could that be? He turned towards the direction of the sound. He saw a figure coming down from the terrace. The figure was holding the pillar for support. Was it also a dream or reality? Or was it a hallucination? Chapter 32 - “Why Do You Torment Me?”  Sundara Chozhan was surprised. I see somebody coming down from the terrace through the pillars. Who can that be? He remembered the confusing dreams he had. Is this a continuance of the dream? Have I not woken up fully yet? The Emperor closed his eyes for a whole minute and then opened them again. He looked in the direction where the mysterious figure got down from the pillar. He could not see anything. He concluded that it must have been a hallucination. He remembered what happened before he dozed off to sleep. The Chief Minister, his disciple, Azhwarkkadian and Thiagavidangar’s daughter who sang in a sweet voice had gone. The Empress and the maids were waiting for his call in the adjacent room. The Emperor remembered the manner in which he spoke of his daughter, Princess Kunthavai, to the Chief Minister. Wasn’t he complaining about her? He felt a strong sense of remorse. Kunthavai’s planning and intelligence was unmatched. She had thought deeply over the matter and finally decided to keep the Prince at Nagapattinam to prevent any possible civil commotion in the Kingdom. And to belittle her forethought had been his greatest blunder, mused the Emperor. Sundara Chozhan knew very well that his mind was not at its best in the recent past. The Princess did nothing wrong. Why then did I blame her? It is prudent to leave everything to her decision. The first priority now is to bring the Prince from Nagapattinam. Oh My God! He should not have been caught in the storm and the floods. I should ask Kunthavai about it right now. Sundara Chozhar decided to clap his hands to call those waiting for him in the next room. But what is happening? I can sense some movement near the head of my bed. But the sound of the footsteps is very soft - something like those of a cat, a tiger or a leopard. Who is that? Is that my Queen? Or my daughter? Or a maid? Perhaps they do not want to disturb my sleep. That is why they are walking softly. “Who is that” - The Emperor asked in a soft voice. There was no response. “Who is that? Come before me.” The Emperor shouted. There was no response even now. The Emperor had a sudden flash. Is it her? The woman whose only mission in life is to confuse and frighten me? Or her ghost? The devil that came in my dream has come in person as well. She used to come only at mid-night. Now she has come early in the evening, that too fully dressed and bejewelled? Or perhaps it is already midnight? Have I slept that long? Perhaps that’s why my Queen and my daughter are not here with me. The maids have gone to sleep too. Oh My God! They have left me all alone. And if this is that devil she won’t let me be in peace. She won’t leave me till my heart bursts in shock and grief. “Devil! If it’s you, then for heaven’s sake, come before me. Torture me in whatever way you can. And then leave me alone. I can’t simply stand your hovering near the head of my bed, completely invisible to me? You are killing me. Come before me. Come to my presence. Have you come to draw my blood? Kill me with the knife you use to kill the tigers and bears of the forest. But, please, I beg of you, please don’t hurt my children. Yes, I have wronged you. But don’t take revenge on my innocent children. They have never hurt you. They never even thought of doing so. Tell me, what wrong did I do to you? Did I ask you to jump from the light house and kill yourself? You did that on your own. Why are you tormenting me?”  Sundara Chozhan felt the presence of the mysterious figure very close to him. His body trembled in fear. He felt as if his intestines had coiled up and blocked his chest. And that his heart rolled up and blocked his throat. He felt as if his eyes were bulging out of his face that they may soon fall down. Yes, it’s her. The fisherman’s daughter, who has been torturing me for a long, long time. No, it’s not her but her ghost! The ghost has come for its ultimate revenge. It is now thirsty. For blood. It wants to draw blood. Blood for blood! Either the ghost will stab me or might wring my neck and suffocate me to death. Let her wish be fulfilled. What’s the point in my living? I won’t be of any use to anybody. And if the ghost kills me now, then it won’t hurt my children. It’s better that way. Sundara Chozhan felt that if only he lifted his head a little and look deeply he would see the ghost of Mandhakini. It appeared as if the mysterious figure was very close to his head. He could even feel the ghost’s shadow falling on him. He wanted to lift his head to have a look. At least once. But he could not gather enough courage for that scary task. Let me close my eyes tight. Let it do whatever it wants to. The Emperor did not move. Nothing happened. A sharp knife did not pierce his heart. Nor did some ghostly hands wring his neck. It appeared as if the ghost had moved away from him. No, she would not let me die so easily. She would rather prefer to keep me alive so that she can torment me whenever she feels like it. Somehow she managed to escape my eyes today. Let me call somebody. If there are other people around, she will vanish. “Anybody there? Where have you all gone?” - The Emperor shouted before he opened his eyes. Oh My God! Who is standing at the foot of my bed? Yes, it’s her. There is no doubt about it. It’s that mute ghost. And like a typical ghost she has let her hair loose. I can see blood on her forehead. Perhaps she is telling me in sign language that she has come to draw blood. Blood for blood! My blood! Sundara Chozhan shouted at the figure as if he were possessed. “YOU DUMB DEVIL! You tortured me with your silence even when you were alive. And you are torturing me with your silence even now. Why have you come here? If you want blood, take it. Take all the blood in my body. It’s all yours. Why are you standing like that? Why do wear that pitiable expression on your face? Have you come to demand anything else? Then tell me. What do you want? Tell me. If you can’t talk at least show some signs. Don’t torture me by just standing before me doing nothing. “Why are your eyes brimming with tears? Are you crying, by any chance? I can’t stand it. If you have something to say, please speak. Or else, get lost. You won’t go? You refuse to go? Why are you adamant? Aren’t you the one who tried to smother my son, my little innocent child to death, in Cauvery? Because of God’s grace it didn’t happen. Your plan did not succeed then. Nor will it ever succeed in future. Because God is on my side. Devil! Why are you staring at me trying to tear my heart off my chest with your sharp eyes? Go! Go! Get lost! You won’t go? Well, I’ll drive you out of this place. I’ll make you go.”  The Emperor looked for something handy to throw at Mandhakini. There was a small oil lamp near him. It was sturdy as it was made from an alloy of five metals. The King picked up that lamp. “Go. Get lost, you hungry ghost!” The King shouted while throwing the lamp aiming for Mandhakini’s face. It was like the Lord Vishnu releasing his Golden Disc. The lamp was still burning as it flew towards the hapless woman. At that time the figure whom the Emperor thought was a ghost moaned in unbearable grief. It was a high pitch moan. The Emperor’s body shrivelled. His body, the flesh and bones inside his body and even his bone marrow froze. Fortunately the burning lamp missed its target. It fell before the ghost-figure with a reverberating sound. The lamp went off. And yet the room was not dark. There was another lamp in the other side of the room. Sundara Chozhan saw the figure still standing there in the faint light. There was inexplicable grief on the face of the figure. The figure looked at the Emperor longingly for a second before attempting to go. It was at that time that the doubt first appeared in the Emperor’s mind. Is it the ghost of Mandhakini? Or some lady who is almost like her? Or her twinsister? Or perhaps... perhaps... perhaps... it’s Mandhakini herself? Then didn’t she die? Is she still alive? Whatever I have been thinking till now is wrong. And if it’s her then Oh My God! What have I done? I tried to throw the lamp at her and kill her. What a cruelty! What a heartless act! That explains the change in her expression. Her face shone in sympathy for a while. And then it plunged into grief. No ordinary grief. Grief that cannot be expressed in words. Was she hurt by his cruel act? Oh My God! That’s why she is trying to go. She is looking on all sides. She is planning to run away. “Are you there! Are you the Fisherman’s daughter, Mandhakini? Or her ghost? Or her sister? STOP! STOP! Don’t go. Please tell me truth before you leave. PLEASE!”  As the Emperor was hollering at the mysterious figure several people entered the  \\x0cchamber at the same time making a terrible noise. The Empress, Princess Kunthavai, Vanathi, Poonkuzhali, the Chief Minister, his disciple Azhwarkkadian rushed into the room together. “STOP. Don’t let her run away from here. Ask her why she came here?” - The Emperor screamed.”  Everyone was shocked. The rage on the Emperor’s face and the horror in his voice shocked them. They were even more shocked on seeing Mandhakini Devi at that place. They remained frozen for a moment. The Chief Minister assessed the situation and inferred what could have possibly happened when they were away. He asked Poonkuzhali:  “Hey Gal, is she your aunt?”  “Yes, Minister Sir.”  He then barked orders to his disciple. “Thirumalai, why are you standing like a statue? Mandhakini Devi is trying to run away. Stop her! It’s the Emperor’s command.”  For the first time in his life Azhwarkkadian defied his Master’s orders. “You could have ordered me to stop a cyclone, Master. That could have been easier.”  Poonkuzhali ran to Mandhakini and caught hold of her shoulders. Mandhakini threw her niece’s hands and ran away. Azhwarkkadian acted smart. He ran to the door. He bolted it and stood guard near it. Nobody could open the door either from inside or from outside. Mandhakini Devi now looked like a deer surrounded by hunters. She decided that there was no other way to escape except the route she had taken while coming in. When she looked at the terrace everyone understood her plans. The Emperor was delirious:  “Stop her! Catch her! Ask her why she came. Ask her whom does she wants to kill.”  Mandhakini was preparing to go to the terrace through the pillar near her. Poonkuzhali ran up to her. This time Poonkuzhali did not try to stop her. She spoke to her in sign language. Mandhakini seemed to understand her signs and pointed out the oil lamp lying in the floor. Princess Kunthavai understood the signs. “Appa, did you throw the oil lamp at Periamma?”  “Yes, dear. I could not bear the look of that ghost. I threw the lamp to drive her away.”  “Oh, my dear father, she is not a ghost or a spirit. She is very much a living woman, the best among women. She is my Periamma. She is very much alive. Ask the Chief Minister. He’ll tell you everything.”  Kunthavai told her father and ran to the place where Poonkuzhali and Mandhakini were engaged in a wordless conversation. The Emperor saw his daughter going near Mandhakini. “Dear, don’t go near her. That devil might harm you.”  The Emperor tried to get up from his bed. His love for his daughter made him forget the fact that he could not stand on his own. The Empress held the Emperor’s shoulders affectionately and made him lie on his bed. “Be patient, my Lord. Nothing will happen to your darling daughter. She is in  \\x0csafe hands.”  \\x0cChapter 33 - The Goddess Of The Chozha Clan  Princess Kunthavai went near Mandhakini. Mandhakini looked deep into the eyes of the Princess. What the Princess did next was a surprise to everybody in the room. She prostrated before Mandhakini and touched her feet. Mandhakini’s eyes were full. She bent down, lifted the Princess up and hugged her. Princess drew her closer and then joined her right hand with hers. While remaining in that position she slowly led Mandhakini to the Emperor. It was only then the Empress saw the face of Mandhakini. She saw blood on the forehead of the Mute Queen. She turned to her husband. “My Lord, was it you who threw the lamp at her and hurt her? What have you done, my Lord!” - The Queen almost screamed. “No, no. The lamp I threw did not reach her. She was like this even before I threw the lamp. But this evil woman might put the blame on me. And you’ll only believe her words. I know that all of you are on her side. Oh Malaiyaman’s daughter! I am surprised you too have a soft corner for this devil. Do you know who she is?”  The Empress roared. “I do, my Lord? She is my Goddess. She is the Goddess, the presiding deity of  \\x0cthe Chozha Clan. When my dear son Arulmozhi was about to be drowned in River Cauvery, he was saved only by the grace of this Goddess.”  “Oh My God! You too believe that story? Did Kunthavai ask you to believe such incredible stories?”  “No, My Lord. I am just describing what I saw with my own eyes. Kunthavai was a child at that time and she could not have known. She saved our son Arulmozhi on that day. Earlier she saved you from the clutches of a bear at the Ghost Island in Srilanka. She saved you for the Chozha Kingdom. But for her, the clan would have lost a wonderful Emperor. That’s why I am worshipping her as the Goddess of the Chozha clan.”  “Oh My God! you know that too? And do you know that she has been alive all these days? And not dead as believed earlier?”  “I know, my Lord. I was telling our Chief Minister to bring her somehow from Srilanka.”  “Chief Minister, did you hear the Queen? Is she really that Fisherman’s daughter? Is she still alive? Didn’t you say that she is dead? Did you lie to me? I thought her evil spirit came often to torment me. Was that all mere hallucination? I am already in a state of confusion. And now you have all joined hands to make me absolutely mad. God bless you all.”  “Your Majesty, she is the one. It’s true. She is alive. I am the one who’s guilty, my Lord. There is no scope for a pardon. Even then I have hopes on your mercy..... Your Highness”  \\x0c“Chief Minister, now I know. This is the woman whom you forcibly abducted from Kodikkarai. You said that the woman who came in the palanquin was this boat girl. Even that’s a lie, Minister.”  “King of Kings, please have mercy on me. I beg your pardon.”  “Aha! Begging my Pardon! Good joke! I think this is the first time in the history of the world that a person described as an Emperor and King of Kings was lied to and deceived. Why did you hide things from me? Why didn’t you tell me earlier? You were talking to me for a long time this evening. You could have told me at least at that time. But you didn’t. It’s only now things have become clear to me. I see the truth in what Pazhuvettaraiyars say. You have all joined hands to conspire against me.”  “I concede, Your Majesty, this is a conspiracy. But the conspiracy is not against you. The only thought we all had in our minds was to somehow bring this lady to you. I learnt from the Queen that you were still grieving over the death of this woman. That prompted me to take this decision. The Queen concurred with me. She virtually ordered me to do so. But it was not easy to bring this woman, Your Majesty. If I tell you that she is alive without producing her before you, you’ll find it difficult to believe. That’s why I decided to bring the woman somehow to your presence and then tell the story. Mandhakini Devi had come till the gates of the Fort yesterday and then she vanished. This boat girl came in her place in the palanquin. We spent the whole day today looking for Mandhakini Devi. My disciple saw her climbing the wall of Pazhuvur Palace. And then he did the same thing only to apprehend her. But she was not to be seen inside the palace either. Meanwhile my disciple was caught by the guards of Pazhuvur Palace. Your Majesty, I beg of you to kindly pardon my disciple for that trespass.”  “Is that the only offence which needs a pardon? There are many. Continue the  \\x0cnarration.”  “We waited till evening. We looked for her inside the Pazhuvur Palace. She was not found. When you were sleeping we were in the adjacent room talking about this lady. We suspected that the lady might be hiding somewhere around here and we did not know how to tell you that. And now the lady has come to your place herself. The fruit that slipped from the hand has fallen into milk.”  The Emperor then looked in the direction of Mandhakini. Kunthavai and Poonkuzhali were giving first aid to her. They used a wet cloth to gently wipe off the blood and applied cool sandal paste over the wound. The Emperor asked Poonkuzhali. “Vidangar’s daughter, ask your aunt how she got hurt.”  Poonkuzhali came forward and spoke reverentially. “I asked, Your Majesty. But I can’t understand her words.”  “What does she say? Does she by any chance say that the wound was caused by the lamp I threw at her?”  “Not at all, Your Highness. She says that she hit against a hill. And that she did not notice that she was bleeding.”  \\x0cThe Emperor did something totally unexpected. He started laughing aloud. For years nobody had seen the Emperor laughing so loudly and so happily. It appeared as if he thought of something funny again and again and his laugh became louder and louder. Everyone was watching him with concern. “Chief Minister, why are you staring at me? Are you thinking that I’ve become mad once again? Not at all! You want to know the reason for my laugh? This lady is telling that she hit upon a hill. And that too in the Chozha country. How can I not laugh, tell me! Why talk about a hill? There is not even enough stone to make a small statue here in Chozha Kingdom. Even if somebody wants to throw a stone at the Chozha Emperor he has to import it from outside. And now this lady claims that she hit against a hill in Chozha Kingdom. What hill did he hit against? Poonkuzhali, why don’t you ask her?”  Vanathi was listening to this conversation. Her face glowed all of a sudden. She understood. She came two feet forward and paid her respects to the Emperor. “Your Majesty, I know what she says. I’ll be happy to share my knowledge if I have the permission of Your Highness.”  “Kodumbalur Princess! You too are here? I didn’t see you till now. I am surprised that you have not fainted in this melee. Tell me what you think about the lady’s words.”  “This Devi said that she was hurt because she hit against the hill. I think I know what she means.”  \\x0c“What is that? I know you are a smart girl. You might have understood the real reason. Come on. Fast! Tell me! Does she want to say that she hit against a hill in Lanka and came here bleeding?”  “No, my Lord. There’s a hall of sculptures in the Palace Garden. In that hall there’s a sculpture depicting the Demon Ravana holding the Kailash Mountain aloft. Perhaps she hit against that mountain.”  Everyone was surprised at Vanathi’s beautiful insight. “May be.”  “Quite Possible.”  “That’s it.” - People were exclaiming while glancing at Vanathi with admiration. Princess Kunthavai placed her hand on Vanathi’s forehead. And then she mimicked the gesture to ward off evil eyes. “You are a genius, my dear. That didn’t strike us at all. I am very happy, dear.”  Poonkuzhali was looking at the scene with raw fury in her eyes. She then spoke to her aunt in sign language and relayed the conversation to the audience. “Yes, that’s what she says. It’s the mountain in the Sculptures Hall that hit her. I too would have guessed it right had I seen the hall earlier.”  The Emperor was now staring at Mandhakini. “Yes. She did not know where to go. And hit against the sculpted mountain. We don’t know where she wanted to go. She arrived here at last.”  The Minister responded to the Emperor. “She wanted to meet you, Your Majesty. There is no doubt about it. She was looking for a way to do it. I was telling these people that she won’t go without seeing you.”  “I don’t believe that, Chief Minister. If she had wanted to come she could have come earlier. She did not turn up for twenty five years. Why should she come now? Why should she haunt me like a ghost? Yes, yes. I thought she was dead and was hovering in the Palace as a ghost. In a way that’s also true. Wasn’t she roaming the dense forests of Lanka like a ghost? All the time I spent my life indulging in the royal pleasures of a Palace. I don’t have words to describe the power of nemesis. I don’t know how many times I was shocked in the past seeing this woman’s ghostly form. Who knows? She might have come on earlier occasions too by stealth to see me. I was terrified because I thought she was a ghost. Oh My God! Twenty five years! Twenty five long years! Twenty five centuries! Twenty five aeons!”  The Emperor was speaking to himself. He suddenly stopped and turned towards the Minister,  \\x0c“Chief Minister, didn’t you seek my pardon for your crimes? May I know what are you guilty of?”  “Your Excellency, it’s neither proper nor just to ask the accused to read out his own charge sheet.”  “Then whom can I ask? Well, I need not ask anybody. The crime is written clearly on your face. It’s as clear as the writing on the wall. You told me that this lady fell into the sea and killed herself. That’s a lie. You’ve been repeating the lie for the past twenty-five years. And I believed you. Minister, yours is a heinous crime.”  “Your Highness, I am not the only one to be charged. This lady is an accessory to the crime. It is true that she fell into the sea. She was rescued. It was almost a rebirth for her. She made me promise to her that I should never reveal to you that she is alive. I refused to give such a promise. Then she threatened to kill herself. I had no other go, Your Majesty. Now is the time, Your Majesty. You can ask her whether I speak the truth.”  “No need, Minister. Let it be like what you said. Even then it doesn’t change the fact that you all joined hands to conspire against me. That was what I said earlier. It’s not wrong.”  “I do concede, Your Highness, there is no pardon for the grave offence I committed. I have been carrying this in my mind for several years. The load has been lifted today. I am free now. Please relieve me, Your Highness. I am planning to go to Srirengam to serve my Lord Renganatha. I want to spend the rest of my life in His service, Your Majesty.”  \\x0c“Impossible, Chief Minister! Your crime has led to many a confusion. It is your duty to clear them before serving Lord Renganatha.”  \\x0cChapter 34 - Ravana In Danger  The Emperor spoke softly to his daughter - “Kunthavai, I need to discuss some sensitive political issues with the Chief Minister. You may all go out to attend to your work. When you go out, take “ this” with you. Let your mother be with me for some time.”  The way the Emperor referred to Mandhakini as “this” showed his hatred for her. Kunthavai looked at her father with disappointment in her eyes. The Emperor noticed her expression:  “It is better to check on this woman. Did she really hit against Mount Kailash sculpture in the Hall as she claims? Take her there to find that out. I can’t bear her standing here.”  Kunthavai’s face fell. She held Mandhakini’s hand and led her out of the chambers. The Empress came near Kunthavai and whispered into her ears. “Darling, isn’t she horrible to look at? What’s the point in blaming your father? Take this lady with you and show all your artistic talents on her. Make her a beautiful woman and bring her back.”  Kunthavai smiled to acknowledge the wonderful suggestion coming from the Empress. Vanathi and Poonkuzhali went along with her. Sundara Chozhan looked alternately at the Empress and the Chief Minister. “I don’t know why you did this to me. If you think that this will make me happy then I’m sorry to say, you’re grossly mistaken. Chief Minister, why the hell did you take so much effort to bring that barbaric creature from Kodikkarai? Tell me the truth at least now. At least from now on please do not hide anything from me.”  The Chief Minister’s response was quite emotional:  “Your Highness I’ll never repeat the same blunder again. I will never hide anything from you. I tried hard only to bring out the truth. You were torturing yourself because you thought this woman died because of you. I thought that you had forgotten that altogether. Later I came to know that you could never forget that; or forgive yourself for that. The Empress told me that on many days you dreamt about this woman and shrieked in the middle of the night. The grief of the Empress was much more than yours, Your Highness. She asked my advice on the matter. We started working on this, Your Highness. You thought that you were responsible for the death of that woman. So we thought that the best way to remove your guilt is to produce the lady before you. We could not think of any other way to assuage your feelings of guilt. We thought you won’t believe us unless you see her in person. That led to all this mess, Your Highness. If you think our motives are wrong, we seek your forgiveness.”  These words actually added fuel to the fire. “Yes, it’s wrong. It’s a crime. Till today she was haunting me as a devil. She was disturbing me in my dreams. And you have replaced the ghost with a mad woman. Do you think that this will give me happiness? Never! If only you had consulted me before, I would have vetoed the idea of bringing her to my  \\x0cpresence. You were all over-enthusiastic. I will let this pass. You took enormous trouble to bring her here. Tell me how are you going to dispose her off?”  The Chief Minister was rendered speechless with this outburst. The Empress stepped forward to speak. “My Lord, I don’t have any idea of letting my sister go away. Let her stay with me in this palace. I will shower my love on her as if she were my elder sister.”  “Devi, there is no need to prove your love for me by these gestures. I have known in the past twenty five years of living with you, that when it comes to loving one’s husband, you are better than even the legendary Kannaki. Ever since I was afflicted with this dreaded disease you have even neglected your children to look after me. I know what you are doing for me. I know the fast and penance you undertook for my sake. And you need not let a mad woman who till now was roaming in a forest, live with you to prove your love for me. Now, listen to me, Oh Malaiyaman’s daughter! And this is for you too, Chief Minister. “Somewhere in the past when I was staying alone in an uninhabited island I saw this dumb, mad woman. It’s true that I fell in love with her. I am not denying that. But if you think that I am still longing for her company, there cannot be a greater blunder than that. There were so many reasons for my falling in love with her at that time. And that love has now changed into hatred and even disgust. She now torments me in my dreams and even in reality. I can’t even bear to think that she is living in this Palace. Drive her out. Right now! I thought she was a ghost and hence threw the oil lamp at her. If I had known that she was alive I don’t know what I would have done to her.”  \\x0cThe Empress and the Chief Minister were devastated by the revulsion in the Emperor’s voice. They never expected the Emperor to be so cruel. The Chief Minister thought that the Emperor might admonish him only for the earlier lie. The Empress thought that the Emperor might not praise her openly; but inwardly he might appreciate her thoughtful act of bringing the first love of his life. They were disappointed by the Emperor’s words. They were furious with the Emperor. They even started hating him for his harsh words. And the Emperor’s final outburst was the worst. “The world won’t lose anything if this dumb, mad woman dies. If only she had died when she fell into the sea... it could have been much better. Which idiot saved her?”  The Empress could not bear it any longer. “My Lord, I beg of you. Please don’t talk like that. Our elders have said that of all the sins committed by man, ingratitude is the worst. You can even forget the fact that your life was once saved by this woman. But how can you afford to forget the fact that our darling son Arulmozhivarman is alive today only because of her? You can, my Lord. But I can’t. I will be indebted to this angel in all my fourteen births.”  “Devi, why are you repeating the old story now?”  \\x0cThe Empress did not let him complete. “That’s not a story, my Lord. That’s a fact. Arulmozhi told me. He told me that the same angel who saved him from the floods in River Cauvery also saved him from dangers in Lanka. Thank God he is safe at Nagapattinam. Let him be brought here, my Lord. You can find out the truth from him.”  “Yes, yes. Arulmozhi is in Nagapattinam. But what is the guarantee that he is safe? Was he caught in the yesterday’s storm? I am worried, dear. Chief Minister, I am restless. I have lost my peace. I have a strong premonition that a calamity is about to happen to my clan. And this dumb devil coming here at this time looks like a bad omen to me.”  “No, my Lord! Definitely not! The divine woman coming here is definitely not a bad omen. I will say that her presence here is possibly the best security for our clan. I am sure my Holy Mother Durga Parameswari, pleased by my constant prayers, has sent her here.”  “No, not at all! She was not sent by Durga Parameswari, but by the Saturn, the evil God. Send her away. If you fail to do that I’ll do it myself.”  “My Lord, I beg of you, please grant me this boon. Let the woman stay in our Palace till Arulmozhi comes here.”  The Queen’s voice was choked. And to strengthen her prayer she bowed down and touched the Emperor’s feet. “Did you hear that plea, Chief Minister? The passionate plea coming from Malaiyaman’s daughter. The plea coming from a woman who still believes that all that glitters is gold. I don’t think there can be anybody in the world half as gullible as her. She has never asked anything from me till now. And the very first boon she has asked from me is like this. What can I do, tell me. I don’t have the heart to refuse her request. But take it from me, every minute the dumb devil stays in this palace will be hell for me. So make arrangements to bring the Prince from Nagapattinam immediately.”  “As you wish, Your Highness. Shall I openly send our cavalry and our elephantregiment to bring back the Prince or else… “  “You want to bring him in disguise. In stealth. Without anybody knowing it. Right? And you think if the Prince were to come here openly there will be chaos in our Kingdom. Right?”  “I don’t just think, Your Highness. I know for sure. The people are agitated for various reasons. They are waiting for some excuse now. And if they have it there will be a revolution. I can’t say what will happen to the Pazhuvettaraiyars and Madhuranthakan.”  “What are you talking, Chief Minister? If people become unruly then what happened to our vast army? Can’t they quell the violence?”  “The army is even more agitated than the people, Your Highness. People will at the most shout a few slogans and walk away. But our army won’t rest until they demolish the Thanjavur Fort, imprison the Pazhuvettaraiyars and Madhuranthakan and place Arulmozhi on the Chozha throne.”  \\x0c“It seems you too want the same to happen. People are confused by the cock and bull stories woven by some foolish astrologers. But have this firmly in your heart. My cousin - my grandfather’s brother’s son - Madhuranthakan is the only rightful heir to the Chozha throne. I have decided to make him the Emperor. I don’t care if people object to that. I don’t care even if the gods or the Holy Trinity opposes my decision. And if my sons oppose my decision... well they had it.”  The Empress intervened. “That will never happen, my Lord. Your sons will never go against your wishes. Arulmozhi is not enamoured by the throne. The Lankan Crown was offered to him literally on a platter. He refused it. Do you think that a person of such a calibre will go against your wishes? What about your elder son, Karikalan? It was you, my Lord, who made him the Crown Prince. That was the only reason he accepted that position. Should I tell about his strength and valour? He is capable of creating a kingdom for himself with the help of his sword. But he too is not interested in being the King. You just have to tell him what’s in your mind, my Lord.”  “He is afraid that I might tell that to him. He doesn’t want to hear that from me. That is why he refuses to come here. I have sent for him many times.”  “Your Majesty, the Crown Prince has built a golden palace for you at Kancheepuram and is waiting for you.”  “I know what he is waiting for. You know Kamsa of mythology? Kamsa threw his parents behind bars and became the king. In the same way this son of mine will put us in prison and then ascend the Chozha throne. I don’t know whether he has built a golden palace or a treacherous palace of lac, like the one built by  \\x0cKauravas to kill Pandavas.”  The Empress was shocked. “Your charge against our son Karikalan is quite terrible. I can’t bear to hear it, my Lord!”  The Chief Minister told in an emotional voice. “The Emperor’s mind has been poisoned by the evil elements.”  “Nobody can poison my mind except my own son, Karikalan. If he is truly my son why didn’t he come here in spite of my repeated requests?”  “He must have strong reasons, my Lord.”  “Why don’t you guess at least one of those strong reasons?”  “People say that if Karikalan crosses River Coleroon he might be arrested by the Pazhuvettaraiyars.”  “Somebody has spoilt my son’s mind. I know who did that. Probably this woman’s father, Thirukkovalur Malaiyaman. And another person is Kodumbalur  \\x0cVelar. Perhaps you have also joined the gang, Chief Minister.”  “My Lord, I never talk behind people’s backs. A short while ago you talked about some danger and the strong sense of premonition. That’s true, my Lord. A calamity awaits the Chozha clan. That can come in two ways. There are two different conspiracies happening against our clan right now. The Pazhuvettaraiyars and the Sambuvaraiyars.”  “Stop it, Chief Minister! The Pazhuvettaraiyar clan has been serving our clan for more than a hundred years. The Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar has fought in twenty four battle-fronts and has sustained sixty four wounds for the sake of our country. Instead of saying that such a man is working against the interest of Chozhas you can very well say that the sun has lost its light. That will be more credible, Minister.”  “Your Highness, even the great sun is caught in an eclipse once in a while. Our scriptures say that a great fire is there underneath the cool waters of an ocean. I am not talking about that, Your Majesty. I am not saying that the Pazhuvettaraiyars are working against the Chozha clan. I am only saying that they are desperate on crowning Madhuranthakan.”  “What is wrong in that, Minister? What is wrong in desiring the Crown for the only son of the greatest devotees of Lord Shiva, the great Kandaraathithar? And Madhuranthakan is after all the rightful heir to the throne.”  “I do not deny that, Your Highness. You have come forward to give the throne to Madhuranthakan. Then how can Pazhuvettaraiyars be blamed. They are only working overtime to carry out your wishes.”  \\x0c“Hence they deserve more gratitude from me and my family.”  “But, Your Highness, they also do certain things without your permission. They are planning to divide the Chozha Kingdom into two parts and give the one South of Cauvery to Madhuranthakan and the one north of Cauvery to Karikalan. That is the discussion currently going on in Sambuvaraiyar’s Palace. Your Highness, do you agree for splitting this great country? Remember Your Majesty, it took more than a hundred years of struggle for your ancestors like Vijayaalaya Chozhan, Adithya Chozhan and the Great Paranthaka to consolidate and expand the borders of this magnificent kingdom from Srilanka to Godavari in the North. Do you agree to break the great Kingdom, Your Majesty?”  “Chief Minister, I will never, never consent to that absurd idea. I will rather ask them to split me into two before splitting the Chozha Kingdom. I don’t think Pazhuvettaraiyar will take part in such a disastrous act. I don’t believe that, Minister. Perhaps he is doing that out of his love for me. Perhaps he wants to give at least half the kingdom to my son. But if only he knows that I don’t like the split he’d abandon the idea. I will make Madhuranthakan the King. And I’ll see to that his Kingdom is not even an inch less than the one I ruled. I won’t care even if the people oppose me. I won’t care even if Pazhuvettaraiyar opposes that idea. I’ll listen to none. Is that clear?”  “Your Highness, you can ignore Pazhuvettaraiyar’s opposition. Your sons are not going to oppose you. But these are not the only blocks in making Madhuranthakan the King. The opposition is coming from a much higher place. The opposition comes from a lady whom the people of Chozha Kingdom worship as a Goddess. I tried talking to her a few days ago... “  “I know you are referring to Queen Mother, Sembian Madevi. Somebody has poisoned her mind too. She thinks that I want to crown my son. Chief Minister, please make arrangements to bring her here immediately. I’ll change her mind.”  \\x0c“Your Highness, it is easier said than done. The great Saint Kandaraathithar has given the orders to his wife before he died. I was with him when he died. I still remember his words. “Madhuranthakan should never be crowned. I have a very, very strong reason. Only my wife knows it.” Those were his exact words.”  “Chief Minister, is there really such a strong reason against Madhuranthakan becoming the King? Do you know that, Minister?”  “If only I had known that I would not have waited till you ask for it, Your Highness. You will have to know it only from the Queen Mother when she comes here.”  “Yes, that is still nagging my mind. Make arrangements to bring the Queen Mother immediately. I will remove the block in her mind, however large or however complex it may be. Who can we send to bring her? I’ll send my daughter, Kunthavai. She is the right person. Devi, please bring Kunthavai here immediately.”  The Empress was listening to the conversation between the Emperor and the Chief Minister. But a part of her mind was with the mute queen. When the Emperor asked her to bring Kunthavai she rushed to the ladies chambers. She was startled to see Kunthavai, Vanathi and Poonkuzhali in a state of shock. The Empress knew the reason straightaway. Mandhakini was not there. When the Empress asked Kunthavai about her, Kunthavai burst out. “Amma, you wanted me to beautify the kind lady. But it was the most difficult assignment, Amma. We forced Mandhakini to have a bath which she reluctantly did. Then we adorned her with new dresses. Vanathi was combing her hair. Poonkuzhali was preparing flowers for her. As I was taking out the jewels for her I heard her shriek. I turned around. Mandhakini Devi was not there. As soon her hair was combed and braided up she freed herself from Vanathi and ran away. We could not see her in any of the rooms. We are still looking out for her. The Empress smiled benevolently. “Was there a mirror opposite to her?”  “Yes, Amma. At some distance from her.”  “She must have seen her on the mirror. She must have been overcome by shyness. She must have run to hide herself. Look for her in all the places. She might have probably gone to the garden attached to the ladies chambers. She is used to scaling walls and going through the windows. Don’t give up.”  They all went to the garden. She was not there. They all became anxious. They first thought of informing the King and the Chief Minister. As they were turning to go they heard a loud noise. It appeared as if somebody was hitting a stone with an iron tool. They now knew that the sound came from the Hall of Sculptures. They sent a maid to fetch an oil lamp. And then went into the Hall of Sculptures. A strange sight awaited them there. Mandhakini now dressed in the best silks of the Palace was wielding a sword with a long handle. She used the sword to strike the hands of the Demon Ravana  \\x0cwho was holding Mount Kailas in his hand in the sculpture. The sculpture was very strong and hence it did not yield to the blows from the sword. But it appeared that the demon in the sculpture might soon be in danger. Twenty hands of the demon king were bearing the mountain. Even if one or two hands are broken the entire weight of the mountain would shift to his heads. And the heads might be shattered with the weight of the mountain. Kunthavai and others entered the hall precisely at this point of time. When Mandhakini saw them she dropped the sword and smiled at them. Everybody except Poonkuzhali thought that Mandhakini was after all a crazy woman. And it was no wonder the Emperor hated her. The Empress told others in a stern voice:”Girls, let nobody breathe about this incident in the presence of the Emperor.”  \\x0cChapter 35 - The Emperor’s Anger  At the time when Mandhakini was discovered in the Hall of Sculptures by the other women a heated argument was going on between the Emperor and the Chief Minister. “Your Highness, I did not want to discuss certain things in the presence of women. But now a time has come that I can no longer hold them back from you. The personal body guards of the slain king Veera Pandiyan are roaming around in our country. They are anxiously looking for the right time to fulfil their deadly vow.”  There was a scornful smile on the Emperor’s face. “That is old news, Minister. Pazhuvettaraiyars have strengthened the security arrangements for me precisely for that reason.”  “My Lord, you know about those crooks. But you may not know that those conspirators are funded from the Chozha Treasury.”  “What is this new yarn you are spinning now?”  “I have much more wonderful yarn to spin, Your Majesty. The new gold coins from Pazhuvettaraiyar’s underground treasury were placed in a heap before those conspirators. Here is a direct eye-witness, my disciple, Azhwarkkadian. He is  \\x0cready to lay bare the details if you so wish, Your Highness.”  “No need. The Pazhuvettaraiyars have been shedding blood for the Chozha clan for so many generations. Even if the legendary king Harichandra, known for his honesty, were to tell me that the Pazhuvettaraiyars are funding those conspirators who want to kill me, I won’t believe him.”  “I beg your pardon, Your Majesty. I am not levelling such a grave charge against the Pazhuvettaraiyars. Perhaps the gold coins are going to the conspirators without their knowledge.”  “Impossible, Minister. Can anybody die without the knowledge of Yama, the Lord of Death?”  “If Yama in his old age had married a young woman even that is possible, Your Highness.”  “I also do not like the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar marrying at this age. I have spoken my mind to him on this matter. But that alone is not sufficient to charge him with sedition. I can’t bear it.”  “My Lord, I am not accusing the Pazhuvettaraiyar. I am accusing his young wife.”  “I can bear your maligning men but not a hapless woman. Especially one as miserable as his young wife. It is disgusting, Minister!”  \\x0c“However disgusting it may be, I have a duty to disclose certain matters about the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur. Once I held back the truth. And I have been regretting that decision till this day. You too were angry with me for that a short while ago. So I have decided to share with you whatever I know. Please give me a patient hearing, Your Highness.”  The Emperor was pleased by the clever words of his wise Minister. He smiled. “You are directing my own words against me? Good. No offence taken. But remember that was purely a personal matter. There is absolutely no relationship between the two. Even then I am ready to hear you. Go ahead.”  “Nandini Devi walked into the Pazhuvur Palace three years ago as the bride of Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar. Since that date some sorcerers have been coming to the Palace quite frequently. Even the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar knows about it. He too hates those sorcerers. But he could not go against his elder brother.”  “Ideal brothers! What affection!”  “But, their brotherly love should not harm the country’s interest, Your Highness.”  “What harm has happened to the country, Minister? Just because a crazy girl foolishly believes in sorcery and has invited some sorcerers to do some tricks, do you think the country’s safety is compromised? Or perhaps do you suggest that the Junior Queen made me fall ill because of her sorcery?”  \\x0c“Your Highness, the Pazhuvur Queen’s visitors are not really sorcerers. I strongly suspect that they are conspirators in the garb of sorcerers. I suspect that the country’s treasures are being robbed by them.”  “Anybody can cast aspersions on anything. Do you have proof, Minister?”  “Oh King of Kings, if only we search Pazhuvettaraiyar’s Palace and the underground treasury we might get some solid proof.”  “Nobody has suggested anything more hateful than that. Chief Minister Aniruddha Brahmarayar, listen. You are just a friend. And that too only to me. But Pazhuvettaraiyar is the best friend of three generations of Chozha Kings. He is like an iron shield to the whole clan. He is like the destructive Vajrayutha of the chief of gods to the enemies of Chozha kingdom. How can I search the Palace belonging to a man of such a stature? I will rather believe that my wife is trying to poison me than believing that the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar is harbouring criminals in his palace.”  “Your Highness, Pazhuvettaraiyar is innocent. Blinded my infatuation for his young wife he does not know what is happening right under his nose. Without his knowledge his Palace has become a sanctuary for the conspirators. I have grounds to believe that the Junior Queen is part of the gang.”  “What further charges are you going to level against that innocent girl?”  “A few days ago a coronation ceremony was performed at the Prithvipathi’s War  \\x0cMemorial in the forest of Thiruppurambayam. A five year old boy was made to sit on a throne and was crowned as a Pandya King. Those who took part in this ceremony vowed to destroy the Chozha clan without a trace.”  “Chief Minister, do you by any chance want to frighten me with this piece of information? Do you expect me to shake in fear?”  “Not at all, Your Highness. I never gave a damn to that mockery. But I just wanted to say that the Pazhuvur Queen was one among those who vowed to destroy the Chozha clan.”  “Now tell me which super-intelligent guy saw that ceremony and shared that information with you. Perhaps this disciple of yours?”  “No, Your Highness. Azhwarkkadian went there after the ceremony was over. The one who saw it was the warrior of the Vana clan, Vandhiya Thevan.”  “You mean the spy who came here once and then ran away?”  “He is not a spy, Your Highness. He is the best friend of your dear son, Adithya Karikalan.”  “Karikalan has so many friends like him. And each friend will have his own way of seeing things. Let us assume what this man told you to be true. But we cannot do anything about it. Pazhuvettaraiyar is not in station. The Junior Queen also is not there. Let us discuss this issue after they come back. But Minister, after  \\x0chearing about the Pazhuvur Queen I am curious to see her. “When Pazhuvettaraiyar told me that he had married a young girl I was so disgusted with him that I forbade him from bringing his young wife in my presence. Perhaps she hates me for that. As soon as Pazhuvettaraiyar comes back I will ask him to bring his wife so that her hard feelings towards me are removed.”  “A very good idea, Your Highness. I was about to suggest that. You need to pacify her for other important reasons as well. I want your permission to let the Lankan Queen stay in our Palace till the Pazhuvur Queen comes back.”  “Oh, you have crowned her the Lankan Queen? Have your way. Let her stay here. But tell me the connection between her and the Pazhuvur Queen.”  “That is precisely what we should find out, my Lord. If the two women meet face to face we will know the connection, Your Highness. That might even soften Nandini’s heart and remove the enmity she has for the Chozha clan.”  “Chief Minister, I am surprised that you are so overly concerned with a woman’s enmity.”  “I have strong reasons, Your Highness. But I am afraid whether it will be proper to disclose them now.”  “If you don’t tell me then nobody else will. Please go ahead.”  \\x0cThe Chief Minister thought for a while and then started to talk. “Your Highness, what I am about to say is a little complex. I don’t think you’d like to hear this. But I beg of you, Your Highness, please listen to me. Whosoever has seen Nandini and Mandhakini Devi are surprised by the striking resemblance they bear to each other.”  “There are so many things like that in the world. Haven’t we seen a tree which exactly resembles another? Likewise there is a mad woman who closely resembles another. What is the big deal in that?”  “But a tree does not act like another. A mad woman does not act like the ghost of another mad woman and torment the Emperor of a Kingdom.”  “What are you insinuating, Chief Minister?”  “You have been lamenting that Mandhakini’s spirit has been haunting you in the nights… “  “Oh do you mean to say that her spirit did not come and that she came herself.”  “No, Your Highness. Nandini acted like Mandhakini’s ghost and tortured you.”  \\x0cThe Emperor sat up on his bed. His eyes went red and his body shook in anger. “If what you say is true then I will wring the neck of that devil with my own hands and... “  The Chief Minister did not let him complete the sentence. “Please, Your Highness. Please don’t take such vows.”  “Why? Why are you soft towards her? The damned lady gave me real hell. No punishment can be harsh for what she did to me.” The Emperor was furious. “What if the tormentor happens to be a close relative... perhaps your own daughter...? “  “Chief Minister, are you in your senses or what?”  “I have tested your patience, Your Highness. Please give a suitable punishment for me. But don’t ever think of punishing Nandini Devi. She is not just the young wife of Pazhuvettaraiyar. She is the daughter of the Emperor of the Three Words, the Great Sundara Chozhan. Who in the world has the right to punish her, Your Highness?”  The Emperor was stunned. He was staring at the Minister for a while. Then he burst out into laughter. “Your Highness today is a red letter day in my life, for I have seen you laughing twice.”  “Chief Minister, I thought there is only one madcap in this Palace. I now realise that you are a greater lunatic than her. The only difference between you two is that she cannot talk while you can.”  The Emperor started to laugh again. Chapter 36 - Late In The Night  The Emperor was still laughing when the women entered his chambers. First came the Empress. She was followed by Mandhakini Devi held on two sides by Princess Kunthavai and Vanathi. They were followed by Poonkuzhali and a maid. They came in a formation. The women’s face brightened on hearing the Emperor’s laugh. Mandhakini lifted her face to see the Emperor and then looked down. The efforts to beautify her had reached a perfectly logical conclusion. Kunthavai was celebrated as the best beautician in the Kingdom in those days. And that made many Chieftains in the Chozha Kingdom send their daughters to the Emperor’s palace to learn the art from Kunthavai. She had lavished all her skills on the Mute Queen. By a strange intuition she had done Mandhakini’s hair like that of the legendary woman-saint, Andal. And this made the Mute Queen strongly resemble Nandini. As soon as Mandhakini’s hair was done every woman recognised the striking resemblance between her and Nandini. Unlike other women of her age Mandhakini had not adopted a sedentary life style. She had been roaming in the forest all her life and this fact substantially reduced the effect of the differences in age between the two women. Mandhakini should be older than Nandini by at least twenty five years. But she looked much younger than her age. The women felt proud in presenting Mandhakini to the King. And every woman had her own reasons. At that time in history it had been the practice of the Emperors and Chieftains of  \\x0cTamilnadu to have many wives. Wars were the order of the day. The young Princes remained at the battle-front most of the time risking their precious lives. The King married many women in his anxiety to leave an offspring. The Queen, or the first wife, had to be adept in the art of being friends with her rivals - her husband’s other wives. Absence of jealousy over the other women and the ability to move with them as close friends were prized traits of an Empress. For the reigning Empress, Mandhakini’s arrival afforded the best opportunity to put that quality to the test. She came out in flying colours. For Kunthavai it was the finest expression of her art. She was proud. For hadn’t she changed the crazy looking forest woman into a beauty queen within a matter of hours? Poonkuzhali was dancing on Cloud Nine seeing the respect and hospitality shown to her aunt. Wasn’t she treated on par with the reigning queen? She had always thought that the women in the Palace would be vain and arrogant. But contrary to her thoughts the women in the palace were soft, kind, courteous, considerate and even loving. Poonkuzhali was happy beyond words. She was relieved that her aunt had finally found her home. The Emperor was still laughing when a procession of happy and proud women entered his chambers. He glanced at the women. Mandhakini’s appearance jolted him out of his laughter. It appeared as if he could not believe his own eyes. He closed his eyes with his hands and then opened again to take another look. The Chief Minister’s words were still lingering in his mind. The strong resemblance between the figure that tortured him in the nights and the woman standing before him now was quite evident. At the same time he was sharp enough to notice a few differences. He now wanted to explore the mystery further and know the full truth. However his hatred towards the mute queen remained undiminished. But he decided to keep the hatred to himself for the time being. He addressed the Chief Minister:  “Minister, a few minutes ago I called you crazy. Now it seems that I am the craziest of all. From now on in addition to the Doctor, send in a sorcerer too every day. I won’t mind even if you send the same sorcerer who comes to see the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur.”  The Chief Minister was shocked. He muttered a silent prayer - ‘Let not any of those vile sorcerers come a mile near the Emperor.’  “Your Highness, why do we need a sorcerer? Why do we need sorcery at all when we have the greatest of sorcery in our hands - I mean my Lord’s name? The sacred name of Sriman Narayana.”  Kunthavai came forward to talk to her father. “Father, did you send for me? Do you want me to go to Pazhaiyaarai? Father, will you please let all of us women go together?”  The Emperor did not respond to her daughter’s pleas. Instead he spoke to the Chief Minister:  “Minister, I have changed my mind. These girls look so enthusiastic for some strange reason. Looks like they are celebrating the homecoming of a bride. I don’t want to spoil their party. As you advised me a short while ago, let all these  \\x0cwomen stay in the Palace. The Queen Mother Sembian Madevi has very high regards for you. Why don’t you take upon yourself the task of bringing her here? Send your disciple to Nagapattinam. I’ll send word to the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar to bring the Senior and his wife to see me as soon as they return to their base.”  “As you please, Your Highness. But it may take some time for them to reach here. Thanks to the violent storm we had yesterday all our rivers are in spate.”  “No issues, Minister. I have been waiting for so many days. No harm in waiting for a few days more. And if you make arrangements to bring Karikalan as well we can resolve all the burning issues. And if he still refuses to come then I have no other option than undertaking a painful journey to see him. But let us discuss that later. I want you to go to Pazhaiyaarai tomorrow and bring the Queen Mother here as early as possible. When you travel please do have an eye on the damages caused by the storm. Find out whether any further relief measures are necessary. We are focussing too much on the family issues and have forgotten our primary duty - the welfare of our people.”  “No, my Lord. I have not forgotten that. Relief work is in full swing. Your Highness need not worry about it.”  The Chief Minister took leave of him. The Emperor had never felt so peaceful and relaxed in the recent past. The news that Mandhakini had not after all died had lifted a huge burden off his heart. The news that Prince Arulmozhi was safe in Nagapattinam deepened his sense of peace and well-being. The Choodamani Monastery in Nagapattinam was housed in one of the strongest buildings and hence no one living in the monastery was likely to be affected by the previous day’s storm. He no longer worried for the  \\x0csafety of his darling son, Arulmozhi. He felt rather strange when he ruminated on the words of the Chief Minister that the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur might probably be his daughter through Mandhakini. This made him smile quite often. He was teasing the women in his room. He praised his daughter’s skills in beautifying a woman. “Oh My God! Dear, you have made a barbaric creature look like the wife of the Chief of Gods, the Indrani. But tell me do you need to show your skills on an old woman like her? You should show them on a young and beautiful creature like this Vanathi.”  Then he sought for details about Arulmozhivarman from Poonkuzhali. Poonkuzhali shared whatever she knew eagerly with the Emperor. At the end of it she prayed to the King. “My Lord, please allow me to return to Kodikkarai tomorrow morning. I need not worry about my aunt anymore.”  “But what about your another aunt’s son who is down with fever? Should you not be concerned about him? Don’t be in a hurry. Stay here for a few days.”  Poonkuzhali remained silent. The Emperor slept well that night. He did not have many dreams. And whatever dreams he had were good. The women of the Palace who slept in the next room also had a peaceful sleep- except Mandhakini. She was restless. The day’s events disturbed her a lot and did not let her sleep. Her thoughts hovered around the underground treasury and the subterranean passage. She had planned to break the hands of Ravana statue. That would have kind of closed the underground passage. But the other women did not let her execute her plan. That made her restless. She could not sleep with the Emperor being exposed to a grave risk. She was staring at the decorated ceiling for a long time. It was almost three in the morning. She saw a figure through the window that opened to the terrace. She saw a scary face peeping through the window. She was almost sure of the identity of that person. She woke up shocked. She saw the window again. The face was not there. She got up and walked up to the entrance of the next room. The door was open. She could see that the Emperor was in deep, peaceful sleep. She went into the room to have a look at the windows. She did not see anything. She came back. She touched Poonkuzhali. Poonkuzhali did not move. She shook her. Poonkuzhali woke up from a deep slumber. She was shocked on seeing the expression in Mandhakini’s face. Mandhakini signalled her to follow her. Poonkuzhali who loved her aunt and had high regards for her intuitive abilities followed her. Mandhakini walked towards the Hall of Sculptures. She took an oil lamp on the way. Poonkuzhali was a little worried about her aunt’s behaviour. Was she going to try to break the Ravana statue again? But then the sound was sure to wake up others. And if they did it would be proved beyond doubt that her aunt had after all lost her mind. Poonkuzhali decided to stop her aunt. And if she went overboard Poonkuzhali would snatch the hammer from her aunt’s hand. She followed her aunt into the  \\x0cHall. What was that? She sensed movement in one of the heads of the ten-headed demon. No, it was not the head of the statue. A human head had appeared in the middle of the Kailash Mountain. And the human head vanished at once. Was it real? Or an illusion? Or a hallucination caused by her not fully awake mind? Or was it the dance of the shadows of the sculptures caused by the light coming from the oil lamp? Perhaps Mandhakini too saw the face. She went near the Ravana statue. Thank God she did not pay attention to the sword lying nearby. There was a dark space between the Ravana’s heads and hands and the Kailash Mountain. Mandhakini lifted the lamp to illuminate the space. There was a gaping hole there. Poonkuzhali’s earlier guess had been proved right. That was an exit for a secret passage. It had been so cleverly hidden from view. Mandhakini tried to close that exit earlier. But others could not understand her actions and inwardly labelled her a mad woman. And they did not let her block the passage. Poonkuzhali was absorbed in her thoughts when the mute queen asked her to follow her. She got into the small hole and started moving ahead. First her aunt’s body disappeared and then her head and finally the lamp she was carrying aloft. Only a faint light coming from the lamp showed the way. Poonkuzhali constricted her body to squeeze herself into the small passage. A few moments later Poonkuzhali also disappeared. The light of the lamp faded out. The Hall of Sculptures was plunged into darkness once again. The Empress, Kunthavai and Vanathi woke up early in the morning and were shocked to see that Mandhakini and Poonkuzhali were not in the places they slept. They searched for them throughout the Palace, the adjoining garden and even in the Hall of Sculptures. They were not to be found. How could they have vanished from the highly guarded Palace complex was a mystery for the women of the Royal household. When the Emperor came to know of this at first he was a little worried. Then he told in a loud voice as if to console himself. “Good riddance. The crazy women have gone. That is important. How they vanished is not.”  Even as he spoke those words a strange fear gripped his mind. Chapter 37 - Kadambur Agitated  Ever since Adithya Karikalan arrived at the Kadambur Palace the residents and the guests felt like they were treading on a bed of thorns and walking over fire. No one could guess what kind of missiles would burst forth from the Prince’s tongue. The Crown Prince often insinuated about the conspiracy to enthrone Madhuranthakan. That made others squirm in embarrassment. The Pazhuvettaraiyar could not bear the insults hurled at him. At one point he even advised Sambuvaraiyar that they should openly tell the Crown Prince about the Chieftains’ low opinion about him. Sambuvaraiyar was against it. “Please be patient. He is our guest now. And he is a ruffian. What if our words misfire and we get caught in complications? Let’s bide our time.”  Of course Sambuvaraiyar also wanted to tell the Crown Prince that the Chieftains were not so enthusiastic in his becoming a King. But he was not in a hurry. He was waiting for the right moment. The Crown Prince himself gifted the right moment to the two old men. One day while in the presence of all the guests he blurted out:  “I want to seek the advice of my Pazhuvur Pattan (Grandfather) and Kadambur  \\x0cMaman (Uncle). That is the reason I came to Kadambur. Three years ago my father made me the Crown Prince. You all supported his decision. But later, it seems, that the Emperor has changed his mind. I hear that he wants to crown Madhuranthakan. He has been inviting me to come to Thanjavur again and again. On my part I have been avoiding meeting the Emperor. Why should I go? Why should I meet him and openly disobey him? Don’t you think it is prudent to avoid meeting him? My dear Pazhuvur Patta, and you, Kadambur Mama you are great men of age and wisdom. You know the ways of the world. You know what is fair and what is not. You tell me, is it fair on the part of my father to ask me to give up the Crown? And that too after so many years? And is it a crime to turn down such an unfair request?”  Everyone was shocked to hear the exceedingly firm words of the Crown Prince. Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar cleared his throat and bought some time by throwing another question at the Prince. “My Lord, I am sure you would have discussed this with your grandfather. What is Thirukkovalur Malaiyaman’s take on this issue?”  “Aha! You all know the old lion! Do you think he will let his grandson give up his throne to somebody else? He’d rather kill me and my mother, his own daughter. Do you know that he has started gathering an army already? He says that he will wage a war to protect his grandson’s right to the throne. But I am not going to listen to him. I’ll rather go by your advice.”  \\x0cKarikalan talked like a very soft and sensitive person now. Pazhuvettaraiyar was disappointed. “We are not like Malaiyaman. We will never instigate the son to rise against his own father. We are bound by honour and duty to obey the command of the Emperor, whatever it may be. But as seniors who have been serving the country for many generations we have the right to tell what is right in this case. We can’t say that the Emperor’s request is completely baseless. We cannot deny Madhuranthakan’s right to the Chozha Throne. “Since you have asked very specifically we don’t want to hide anything. We’ll tell you what we think. We’ll leave the final decision to you. We think that letting this debate continue any further will harm the interests of the country. It is better that we arrive at some sort of consensus to avoid conflicts. In the olden days the Chozha Kingdom was small and was confined between the two Vellaru Rivers. Today it is vast and is spread all over from Kanyakumari to the banks of River Krishna. Even if we divide the Kingdom into two, each half will be a large Kingdom in its own merit. That way it will be fair to give the area south of River Coleroon to Madhuranthakan and the area north of Coleroon to you, my Lord. This is our compromise formula. If you agree to this arrangement we will go ahead with partition. It will be my personal responsibility to convince the Emperor in this regard.”  Adithya Karikalan’s noisy laugh caused waves of fury to rise in Pazhuvettaraiyar’s stomach. “Patta, You want to divide the Chozha Kingdom into two so that the Pazhuvettaraiyars can rule the Southern Part and the Sambuvaraiyars, the Northern one. It is a good compromise formula. After all your families have been serving the Kingdom since the time of my great grandfather. And this is a fair reward for your services. “But I do not want to divide the Kingdom. Not at all. Dividing the Kingdom and sharing it between two claimants is like sharing one’s wife with others. You old men may not mind that kind of a sharing arrangement. But I am against it.”  Sparks flew in Pazhuvettaraiyar’s eyes. He stood up. He was ready to unsheathe his sword. “Patta, why do you want to quit now? Listen to me. Let me tell you my plan. I hate dividing this great Kingdom. My ancestors and yours struggled for more than five generations, sacrificed the lives of so many warriors, to consolidate the Kingdom and grow it to this size. It is a grave sin to make it small once again by dividing it within the family. Our ancestors like Rajadithya, who are living in heaven, will curse our families. So drop the idea. I am ready to give up the entire Kingdom in favour of Madhuranthakan. In a way it is fair. After all who is Madhuranthakan? He is my grandfather’s brother’s son. In fact he should have been crowned the King in the place of my father. But thanks to Emperor Paranthaka, my father ascended the throne. That’s a mistake and let the same mistake not happen again. Though I have every right to claim the throne under the “son after his father” rule, I’ll give up my claim in favour of Madhuranthakan. I’ll do that on one condition. I want an army of three hundred thousand men to invade north. I want you to give me the arms, weapons and other necessary things for the army. I also  \\x0cwant you to give food for one year for the army. I also want three hundred ships that are seaworthy. I’ll create a Navy and make Parthibendran the Chief of Navy. I’ll make him sail along the coast while I’ll be invading the territories with the army by land. Parthibendran and I will meet at the estuary of Ganges River. Then we will join forces and go further north. One of my forbears, my namesake, Karikal Valavan, went up the Himalayas and hoisted the Tiger Flag in the one of the peaks the mountain range. The poets of our country eulogize him for this achievement. What my ancestor did, I’ll do again. With the help of my sword, with the help of my soldiers I’ll become the Emperor of the territory north of River Krishna. And if I die in war I’ll ascend that heaven reserved for the bravest of brave for I would have died in the cause of establishing my Kingdom. Pazhuvur Patta! Kadambur Mama! What do you say? Are you ready to accept my condition?”  Karikalan paused after delivering a majestic speech. The two old men were shocked. Pazhuvettaraiyar’s voice was shaken. “My Lord, who are we to accept your condition? What right do we have? The Emperor alone has to decide. “  Karikalan was furious. He thundered to the old man:  \\x0c“Patta, how long are you going to deceive us in the name of the Emperor? You can deceive anyone; but not me. You have imprisoned my father in his own palace. You have made him a puppet who dances to your tune. Do you think I don’t know that? Can anybody see my father without the permission of your brother Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar? My father issued orders to arrest my brother in Lanka. Was it because he liked to do that? No, you forced him. Do you think any father will have the heart to have his darling son arrested? Do you think any father will order the arrest his own son, who is of one of the greatest warriors of our times and the darling of the people? The people of Chozha Kingdom are outraged because you arrested the Prince, tortured and killed him by drowning. People are furious over you, Patta.”  “Prince, who told you that? Who levelled that grossly baseless charge against me? Tell me, Prince. I’ll slit open their mouths and cut their tongues. And then slaughter them.”  “If it is just one person you can do whatever you want. Thousands, why, lakhs and lakhs of people are accusing you. And if you want to punish them all the Chozha Kingdom will become a large cremation ground. And if it happened it will be ideal for Madhuranthakan to rule over the country. For he is Lord Shiva’s devotee. And we know that the Lord loves to dance in cemeteries and cremation grounds. But, Patta, I don’t believe their words. People are fools. If one man says something everybody else will repeat it without reflecting on it. You and your ancestors have been helping the Chozha clan for generations. I am sure you would not have done such a heinous act. If Arulmozhi had drowned in the sea it should be because of his destiny. Perhaps he did so to mock at the astrologers and palmists who have been repeating like a parrot that he was born to rule over the three worlds. “You may be the greatest of warriors. Even then you cannot create a storm in the middle of the sea or make lightning strike the sails of his boat. That could be handiwork of the sorcerers of Pandya Kingdom. But you are no way responsible for that calamity. Nor are you responsible for Arulmozhi’s death. But don’t ever say “I’ll have to consult the Emperor” again. Then you will even say, “I’ll have to consult the Chief Minister.” The Emperor and Chief Minister simply bear their respective titles. They cannot do anything without consulting you. Oh yes, you can say, “I’ll consult your grandmother, Nandini Devi.” That will be reasonable.”  Kandhanmaran intervened. “My Lord, you are. ... He is our guest now.... “He was shaken. He spoke out aloud. But the words were not coherent. Karikalan spat fire. “Kandhanmaran, is this your house? I forgot. I even forgot the fact that you are a descendant of the great warrior, Ori of Kollimalai. In your house and that too in your presence, I need to have some kind of fear and restraint. Right? But tell me, what did I say wrong? What did I do to your guests? Why are you trembling now? Perhaps you are afflicted with that viral fever which is rampant in Srilanka. But you have never been to Lanka. How did you get that?”  Vandhiya Thevan stood up. “My Lord, Kandhanmaran does not have any fever. He is upset because you called the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur, grandmother.”  Kandhanmaran glared at Vandhiya Thevan with hostile fury in his eyes. He tried to unsheathe his sword. Parthibendran held his hand and made him sit down. He whispered something in his ears. Kandhanmaran was pacified. But he was still trembling. Karikalan laughed at him before turning to Pazhuvettaraiyar. “Patta, young men will be like that. At times they will be out of our control. Ignore them. In a way you are my grandfather. Then will not the Junior Queen be my grandmother? I am sure you won’t mind my calling her grandmother. I am sure she won’t mind it. I am surprised why these boys are upset about it? Ok, let it go. I have digressed from the main issue. I request you not to shift the burden to my father, the Emperor. If you agree he too will agree to my plan. After all the country’s treasury is under your control. And if I announce that I am going to invade north, not just three hundred thousand, but three million soldiers will volunteer to join my army. Getting me three hundred ships is not a big deal for you. But first you should agree to my plan. And make Madhuranthakan agree. That is all. What do you say?”  Pazhuvettaraiyar was shaken. He was groping for words. At last he cleared his throat and spoke in a trembling voice. “My Lord, I might agree to your strange request. But don’t you think that Madhuranthakan also should agree? Again, how can you go on your great expedition without taking leave of the Emperor? So I suggest that we all go to Thanjavur.”  “I can’t do that, Patta. What if my father orders me to do something else? Then I can’t go against him. My mother, Malaiyaman’s daughter and my sister, Kunthavai may not like my decision of abdicating the throne and going on an expedition. It’ll be very difficult for me to go against their wishes. Patta, this matter has to be decided here in this Kadambur Palace. “I suggest that you go to Thanjavur and bring Madhuranthakan here. Let me explain my stand and help him come to a decision. We will then inform my father. You start making arrangements for my expedition. Once the army, the ships and everything is ready I’ll come to Thanjavur to take leave of my parents. Alternatively, let Madhuranthakan be crowned now itself. And then let my parents come to Kancheepuram. I’ll make them stay in the golden palace built by me. I’ll stay with them for a few days before leaving north.”  Pazhuvettaraiyar looked at Sambuvaraiyar who was looking at the ceiling. Pazhuvettaraiyar knew that he would not get any help from his host. He spoke in a very soft voice:  “How can I go against your orders, my Lord?”  “Don’t say ‘orders’ Patta. You have been serving the nation for decades. Your hair has gone grey in service to the country. How can a small boy like me order you around? Tell me you’ll grant my prayer, Patta.”  \\x0c“Okay, let it be so.” Pazhuvettaraiyar cleared his throat. “Thank you very much, Patta. Please make arrangements for your journey. Fast! Let Madhuranthakan come on an elephant. Or he can ride on a golden chariot. Let him not come in the closed palanquin of the Junior Queen.”  Karikalan laughed. He then turned to Kandhanmaran and others. “Kandhanmaran, you are very fortunate. More guests are coming here. Madhuranthakan who is going to succeed Sundara Chozhan as the Emperor of Chozha Kingdom is going to be your guest. He may even bring with him his wife, the would-be Queen of the Nation, the daughter of Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar. Kadambur Palace will wear a festive look. Let Pazhuvettaraiyar leave for Thanjavur. Come, let us go for hunting. Once I was an expert archer. People used to say, “After the legendary Arjuna the next best is our Adithya Karikalan.” But I have not touched my bow for the last three years. I will have to train myself again. I will need a lot of practice. Parthibendra, Vandhiya Theva! Come let’s go. Let’s start now. Where shall we go? To Kollimalai Forest?”  Sambuvarayar who never took part in the conversation so far ventured to speak. “My Lord, Kollimalai forest is far away. You need not go that far. There is a dense forest in the Western banks of Veeranarayana Lake. It is known as “Dhandakaranyam”. There are a lot of wild animals in that forest. The animals we hunted in that forest are there in our Hunters’ Hall. If you leave early in the morning you can come home by night.”  \\x0c“As you please, Sir. As long as I am your guest in this palace your word is the lay. Can we take your daughter Manimekalai with us? She is a good conversationalist and is adept in creating a joyful atmosphere.”  “I don’t have any objection, my Lord. Let’s find out if Manimekalai is interested.”  Kandhanmaran intervened. “Why do we need women when we go on hunting? That will be a headache for us. We’ll spend most of the time worried about the safety of the women. We can’t focus on hunting. If we take Manimekalai out for hunting then the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur will be left alone without any company.”  “Yes, yes. Kandhanmaran is always worried about Pazhuvur Patti. Coming to think of it there is another problem in taking Manimekalai for hunting. The way she jumps and runs, people may mistake her for a deer and shoot arrows. Let the women stay in the Palace. We shall go for hunting. We need to leave very early in the morning. I presume we have that Kuravaikoothu entertainment in the evening. Let us see that it ends early so that we can retire early. Only then will be able to get up early in the morning. Send word to the hunters right now. Vandhiya Theva, come let’s go to our room.”  The Crown Prince held Vandhiya Thevan’s hand and walked out of the hall. Kandhanmaran and Parthibendran were burning in jealousy. Sambuvaraiyar went away to issue orders to the hunters. The Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar went in search of Nandini. Chapter 38 - Nandini Refused  Pazhuvettaraiyar was excited over the latest developments. He wanted to share his excitement with Nandini. He almost ran towards Nandini’s chambers. He had come to Kadambur with a mission. Till that point of time his mission was a failure. He had thought naively that if only he could manage to bring Adithya Karikalan, who was after all a small boy, to Kadambur he could make him dance to his tunes - either by instilling fear or by implanting greed. He believed that the Crown Prince was bound to act as dictated by him and Sambuvaraiyar. He knew the dangers of making Madhuranthakan the king of the whole Chozha Kingdom. The move will be vehemently opposed by Malaiyaman from the North and the Kodumbalur Chieftain from the South. And if a great warrior like Karikalan joined hands, the result would be a disastrous civil war. No one could predict the outcome of that war. A majority of people would naturally support the sons of the reigning Emperor. Even Madhuranthakan’s own mother, the Queen Mother Sembian Madevi, would work against her son. It was not possible to take part in the war just with the support of Kalamukas. There was likely to be a large scale civil mutiny in the Pandya territory, in the Chera territory and in the provinces north of Paalaru River. So the best way out was to make Madhuranthakan the king of one half of the Kingdom, especially the southern half with Thanjavur as its capital. And later the Pazhuvettaraiyars would gather enough strength and annex the remaining portion of the Kingdom. Once Madhuranthakan was crowned the King it would be easy to destroy the powers of Kodumbalur Chieftain later. Then one could turn north and even crush the forces of Malaiyaman. Karikalan was an over-sensitive, short-tempered, ruffian. Given his nature he was likely to get himself involved in some pointless  \\x0caffair and might even lose his life. If that happened all the problems of Pazhuvettaraiyar would be solved. It would be a matter of mere political procedure to annex the headless state. All these points emerged in the discussion Pazhuvettaraiyar had with his young wife Nandini. It was Nandini who planted the idea of partition in his mind and urged him to present the compromise formula. Pazhuvettaraiyar was convinced about her plan and only then did he decide to go to Kadambur. And requested the Crown Prince to come. But all his hopes were belied. Nothing happened as planned. He thought that Karikalan would show reverence to the old men and that he and Sambuvaraiyar would use that as an advantage to shove their partition plan down his throat. But that never happened. Karikalan virtually humiliated the two grand old men of the Chozha Kingdom. He barked orders to them. He advised them on many issues. He asserted himself and always gained an upper hand in any discussion they had with him. He never listened to them. Pazhuvettaraiyar could not bear his satirical remarks, his double-meaning words and the insults directly hurled at him. Karikalan insisted on calling him an old man; in fact he addressed him only as Patta, grandfather. Nandini who was younger than Karikalan was referred to as Paati, the grandmother. Technically no one could find fault with the Prince. That was a family tradition. But to Pazhuvettaraiyar even the way Karikalan addressed him and his young wife appeared as poisoned arrows directed towards his chest. As if to add fuel to fire even Sambuvaraiyar’s behaviour was not up to the mark. Instead of standing up for Pazhuvettaraiyar and insisting on Karikalan to behave himself, Sambuvaraiyar was a silent spectator most of the time. He spoke hesitantly and it was mostly to adhere to the protocol as a host. Perhaps he was a little overcautious to avoid any untoward event when the Crown Prince was a guest in his Palace. Pazhuvettaraiyar hated Sambuvaraiyar’s diplomatic behaviour. But Adithya Karikalan’s compromise formula changed everything. Pazhuvettaraiyar regained the lost enthusiasm. At the same time he did not know to what extent he can rely on Karikalan’s words. It was difficult whether the Crown Prince was sincere. Did the Prince speak what was in his heart? Or did he hide his real feelings and uttered something to please him? He could never know. Perhaps the Crown Prince might have said all those things to test waters. Or perhaps the Prince had laid a bait to bring Madhuranthakan to Kadambur. Who knows, Madhuranthakan might even be trapped and killed here in Kadambur. The Crown Prince might have even asked his grandfather Malaiyaman to invade Kadambur and hold the Palace under siege after Madhuranthakan came. Pazhuvettaraiyar did not want to take that kind of a risk. Bringing Madhuranthakan here would be worse than putting all his eggs in one basket. The best way out was to go to Thanjavur and consult his brother the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar. The Junior was an excellent strategist. And the Junior can be asked to bring a huge army which should be waiting at the banks of Coleroon for any contingency. But irrespective of the decision he took there was no point in letting Nandini stay in that Palace. She would be insulted by these fools. Now there was an opportunity to take her back and leave her in Thanjavur. Why should he miss this god-given chance? Pazhuvettaraiyar was smiling when reached the chambers of Nandini. When he was near the door he could hear somebody laughing inside his wife’s room. For no reason the sound of laughing irritated him. Nandini never laughed like that when she was in Thanjavur. What made her so happy now? Who was laughing with her? The moment he entered the room he knew that Manimekalai, daughter of Sambuvaraiyar, was laughing along with his wife. He was a little pacified. When Manimekalai saw him she covered her mouth with her hands struggling hard to hide her laugh. But she burst out laughing once again. While still laughing she ran out of the room. Nandini was also laughing. But she stopped abruptly on seeing her husband. She regained her usual majestic poise. “Welcome, dear. Has the discussion ended? So soon?”  Pazhuvettaraiyar ignored her question. “Nandini, why did that silly girl laugh like that? Why is she running away laughing?”  “She overheard part of the conversation that happened in the Court Hall. Her room is adjacent to the Hall and the walls are not perfectly sound proof. She heard that part of the discussion where the Crown Prince talked about his grand fathers and grand mothers. Manimekalai could not help laughing.”  “But why the hell are you laughing with her?”  “Yes. I did. I had to. I was waiting for her to go so that I can cry in silence. And you came.”  \\x0cNandini could muster tears at her will. She wiped her tears. “Oh My God! I was a fool to have brought you here to be in the midst of these idiots. Please bear with these people for just one more night. We shall leave for Thanjavur first thing in the morning.”  “Why? So early? Is our work over here in Kadambur?”  Pazhuvettaraiyar faithfully relayed what happened in the Court Hall. Nandini’s voice was very calm. “My Lord, you go to Thanjavur. I won’t come with you. I won’t leave this place before teaching that arrogant Karikalan a lesson he would never forget in his life. Either he should prostrate before you begging your forgiveness for what he spoke today or he should fall a prey to your sword.”  “What are you talking, Nandini? From when did you become so cruel?”  “Somebody has insulted my dear husband. I want to take revenge. Is this your definition of cruelty, my Lord?”  “No, Nandini. Please listen. Our Pazhuvur clan has been associated with the  \\x0cChozha clan for the past six generations. Simply because a flippant youth forgot history and spoke whimsically, should I take arms against the great Chozha clan? How can I kill the Emperor’s son? How can I kill the Crown Prince with my own hands?”  Pazhuvettaraiyar was trembling. He could not bear the thought of going against the Emperor and the Chozha dynasty. There was another subtle reason for his outburst. When he heard the harsh words of Karikalan his hand had instinctively reached for his sword. But he had controlled himself then. Yes, a few minutes before he wanted to kill the Crown Prince. But when Nandini told him what was in his mind he became nervous. “I understand, my Lord. You were associated with the Chozha clan for the past six generations. Yes, you can’t take the sword against the Crown Prince. But I don’t have any such restriction. I don’t owe any duty to the Chozha clan. If that arrogant Karikalan does not touch your feet I’ll kill him with my own hands.”  Nandini’s eyes had gone red. Her eye-brows were arched in anger. Her face had changed. Pazhuvettaraiyar had never seen so much rage on that beautiful face. Chapter 39 - Calamity Ahead  Pazhuvettaraiyar smiled. He wanted to tease his young wife and so the smile was very mild. At least that was what he thought. But the sound of his smile caused the things in that room to tremble. His heart was about to burst in pride when he heard that his young wife was ready to wield the sword against anyone who insulted him. He had a strange sense of euphoria. He was happy to know that Nandini was very keen in protecting his honour. He wanted her to speak in the same strain for some more time. At the same time he wanted to pretend that he did not like that kind of talk. “Why did you laugh, dear? You don’t believe me?”  “No, Nandini. I fully believe you. I was wondering how you are going to wield a heavy sword with your hand which is as soft as a flower. And what is the need when I am alive and kicking with my two long arms ... “  “I know the power and glory of your arms, dear. Your long arms are like the trunk of an elephant. They are as strong as the Vajrayutha, the formidable weapon wielded by the chief of gods, the Devendra. Your arms have had the honour of killing thousands of enemies in the battle-field. It was your arms that crowned the Emperor of Chozha Kingdom. And it was your arms that saved him from any danger. But who thinks of all those things? Youngsters who are still green behind their ears have started calling you ‘old man’. And you, my dear, behave like a snake which is caught in a spell. You silently bear all the insults because of your devotion to the rulers of the Chozha clan. I know, dear, my hands are very soft. They are fit for wearing bangles. But I held your strong hands in the presence of the holy fire while marrying you. That has given some power to my hands. If there be a need to save my chastity or your honour my arms would get the power to wield the heaviest of the swords. Look here!”  \\x0cNandini bent down and pulled a box from beneath the cot. She opened the box and took out the dresses. She then took out a long, shining sword from the box and lifted it above her head with nonchalant grace. Pazhuvettaraiyar was shocked. “How long was this sword inside this box? I thought the box had nothing but your dresses.”  Nandini kept the sword inside the box. “Yes, I keep my dresses and jewels inside this box. Of all the ornaments I have this sword is the most precious. And this sword has the power to guard the most precious ornament of a woman - I mean my chastity and it can save my husband’s honour as well.”  “But I don’t think you will have a chance to use this sword; at least as long as I am alive.”  “That is why I never take this sword out of this box. You are capable of protecting the borders of this vast kingdom which extend from Sri Lanka to Vengi country. Can’t you protect yourself? You can guard an ordinary girl like me with your strength, dear. But you are always involved in very important affairs. You can’t be thinking about my safety all the time. When you are away on duty I should have some means to guard myself. That’s why I keep this sword along with my dresses and jewels.”  \\x0c“What is the need, my dear? Of course you can keep the sword. But I won’t be away from you in the future.”  “That’s my wish too, dear. But just for once you may have to leave me here and go to Thanjavur to fetch Madhuranthakan.”  “Why? Why are you adamant? Why should I go alone?” Pazhuvettaraiyar arched his brows and raised his voice. Nandini was unfazed. “There are two reasons, my Lord. If you take me with you those idiots would make fun of both of us. ‘The old man doesn’t believe his young wife.’ They will talk behind our backs. My blood boils when I hear such comments. But there is another important reason, my Lord. You have been telling all along that Sambuvaraiyar is your best friend. But ever since the Crown Prince came here I see a change in his behaviour. Did you notice?”  “Yes, dear. I too have been watching. I wonder what made him change.”  “You are still innocent, dear. That’s why you are surprised by his change. But I am not. Ambition is the basic trait of every man. And that is the reason for the change you find in him. It was rumoured till now that the Crown Prince never looks at women and has no idea of marrying anybody. But the Crown Prince’s behaviour in this Palace belies those rumours. He visits the ladies’ chambers quite often. He talks with the women. He flirts with them. Do you know the  \\x0creason? He is attracted to Sambuvaraiyar’s daughter, Manimekalai. Didn’t he ask, “Can we take Manimekalai with us for hunting?” Sambuvaraiyar has also noticed this change. A new desire has entered his mind. He has forgotten all our old plans. He has started dreaming of seeing his only daughter as the Empress of Chozha Kingdom.”  “You are right, Nandini. I never thought Sambuvaraiyar will stoop to that level. Two months ago we all joined hands to take a vow to make Madhuranthakan the next Chozha Emperor. But this man, blinded by ambition, has gone back on his word. He is not fit to be a human being.”  “That is the precise reason I do not want to come with you. I’ll be watching the actions of these people during your absence. And if they plan something against your interests I’ll give my life and soul to thwart their plans.”  “But Nandini, why should you get involved in all these dirty affairs?”  “Am I not your life-partner, dear? Whatever affairs you are involved I will also be involved. What for did you marry me, dear?”  “But Nandini I don’t want to leave you in the midst of fools and crooks. I don’t have the mind to leave you here, my dearest.”  “I am not alone, dear. I have company. I have good support. Manimekalai is there for me. She will even die for me.”  \\x0c“That’s true. I also noticed. Your beauty has enslaved her. But how long will that last? If Adithya Karikalan becomes the King and promises to make her his Empress?”  “You need not have any doubt on that front, dear. Manimekalai will refuse such request even if it comes from the chief of gods, if I do not approve of the match. If I give this sword to her and ask her to stab Karikalan she will do it for me. You used to talk about my seductive power. Manimekalai is now completely under its influence. If you want I can demonstrate my power to you right now.”  Pazhuvettaraiyar’s body trembled in fear. With his lips quivering he spoke in a choked voice. “Devi, I know your powers. But don’t test them on Karikalan. He is after all a kid. Let us not take his words to heart. If he wants to marry Manimekalai let us not stand against it.”  “Yes, my Lord. Let us not oppose the marriage. But we should not forget that there is something called destiny. Who can oppose Destiny, tell me. Manimekalai adores me. And I love her. I love her like my own sister. How can I let her marry a person who is going to face an untimely death?”  Nandini had a distant stare on her eyes. Pazhuvettaraiyar was more nervous now. “Oh My God! What are you saying, Nandini? I was once the head of Velakkara Army, the King’s bodyguards. I have sworn to give my life in order to protect the lives of the Emperor and his family.”  “I never said that you should act against your promise.”  “But, dear, if Karikalan is hurt because of you, the blame will fall on me. The whole world will accuse me” “Unable to bear a kid teasing him the old man has committed this heinous crime.” And our family will lose the name and honour that has been earned during the last six generations.”  “Then it is all the more important that you should leave this place immediately.”  “What makes you say that?”  “I have been wanting to share that with you for quite some time. Now the time has come. You know that the Goddess Durga Parameswari has given me some unusual powers. It was through those powers I learnt that Emperor Sundara Chozhan is guilty of killing a woman in his younger days. I proved that to you as well. “In the same way I now see the end of Adithya Karikalan with those divine powers. No, it is not going to happen because of you. Or me. But I am sure that the Goddess of Death is nearing him. He might die while he goes for hunting. Or might die while sleeping in this Palace. His death can be caused by wild animals like a tiger or a bear. Or he may die in the hands of one of his close friends, whose arrow might miss the target and hit him. Or he may die being killed by a dagger in the soft hands of a woman. But my dear, I promise you, his death will  \\x0cnot be caused by the hands of a woman who has married you in the presence of the holy fire. No, I assure you I won’t kill him. “I was an orphan on the street. You married me and made me the Queen of Pazhuvur. And it will be my first duty to make sure that you are not blamed in this affair. And that is the reason I insist that you should leave the place right now. If something happens to the Prince when you are here then the whole country will say that you killed him. Didn’t they blame you for Arulmozhivarman’s death on the high seas? In the same way you will be blamed even Karikalan’s death is nothing but an accident. But take it from me you cannot prevent his death even with your strong arms. “So you should leave this place. Right now. Yes, you can take me with you. But that will make people suspicious. They will say, ‘Pazhuvettaraiyar knew this was going to happen. So ran away from the scene along with his wife.’ You should go alone. I will be here to save your name and honour, dear. Do you trust me, my Lord?”  Nandini directed her big, black eyes at Pazhuvettaraiyar’s chest. It appeared as if she was trying to pierce his chest with that pointed glace. Poor soul! Pazhuvettaraiyar was visibly shaken by the arrows which came from her mouth as pointed words. And now he could not stand the attack of arrows coming from her beautiful eyes. He surrendered to her charms. Chapter 40 - Water Sports  Six hundred years before the time of this story there were seven famous Chieftains in Tamilnadu apart from the three great Tamil Kings - Cheras, Chozhas and Pandyas. The seven chieftains were also known as great philanthropists. It is customary to refer to them as “The Seven Great Philanthropists.” One of the seven was Ori, who ruled over the Kolli Hills. Ori was an acclaimed master in archery. He was compared to Lord Rama in archery. Once Rama shot an arrow to prove a point, or rather to prove his prowess to King Sugriva who was about to forge alliance with him. The arrow pierced seven trees which were not in a straight line. Similarly there was a legend that the arrow shot by the great Ori first pierced the body of a tiger, a deer, a boar and finally a rabbit. The great poets of Tamilnadu have glorified Ori’s archery in their songs. And because of this he was called as the “One Who is Adept In Wielding A Bow” or ‘Val-vil Ori’  Once one of the three Kings of Tamilnadu, the Chera King was furious over Ori. The Chera King wanted to finish off Ori; but he could not do it alone. He sought the assistance of Malaiyaman Thirumudikkari. Kari was no less than Ori. And Kari had an added advantage. He had a much stronger army than Ori. Malaiyaman invaded the Kolli Hills, killed Ori and destroyed the fort built by him on the hills. Athikaman Nedumananchi was a Chieftain, like Ori. He was ruling over a small territory which was adjacent to Ori’s called, Thahadoor. Ori was his best friend. And Nedumananchi wanted to avenge his friend’s death. He knew very well that he could not invade Malaiyaman Kari without help from other chieftains. He sought the help of the Chozha King at that time, one who went by the name Killivalavan. Killi Valavan was already displeased with Malaiyaman because of his growing strength and his allegiance to the Chera King. Killivalavan was, therefore, only too eager to help the campaign launched by Athikaman Nedumananchi. They joined hands to attack Malaiyaman. Malaiyaman could not withstand the onslaught and he died on the battlefield. His two sons were held captive by the soldiers of the Chozha Army. Killivalavan and Athikaman wanted to destroy the entire clan of Malaiyaman. The children were buried in sand up to their neck. The King’s elephants were order to trample them. A poet who had once sung the praises of Malaiyaman and had gained personally by his philanthropy reached the place at the nick of time. He made a passionate plea to the Chozha Emperor on behalf of the innocent children. “Your Majesty, please see the smile on the faces of these innocent children. They are too young to know about their destiny. Blissfully unaware of the approaching death they are laughing at the elephant’s trunk, which is dangling from its neck. They perhaps think that this is a different kind of circus. Are you going to kill these innocent children, Your Majesty? Is it fair to kill the children for the faults of their father?”  The Chozha King changed his mind. He rescinded his orders. He ordered that the children be retrieved. When the children came of age he made the eldest son the ruler of Thirukkovalur. From that time onwards the clan of Thirukkovalur Malaiyaman had been faithful friends of the Chozha clan. It was friendship rooted in gratitude. The relationship extended till the time of Sundara Chozhan, for the Emperor had married, Vanamaadevi, who was the daughter of Malayaman. Meanwhile the clans of Ori and Athikaman lost their powers and vanished from history. The Kadambur Sambuvaraiyars claimed that they were descendants of Ori and Athikaman. They never forgot the enmity of Oris with the Malaiyamans. In these circumstances it was quite natural that the Sambuvaraiyar did not want the grandson of a Malaiyaman to become a Chozha Emperor. Adithya Karikalan’s arrogance, his attitude of treating the Chieftains like dirt fuelled the hatred of Sambuvaraiyar. That made him actively participate in the conspiracy to place Kandaraathithar’s son, Madhuranthakan, on the Thanjavur throne. But ever since Karikalan came to Kadambur, Sambuvaraiyar’s mind was going through a gradual change. It was his darling daughter Manimekalai, who brought this change in her father. There were unmistakable signs that Manimekalai had stolen the heart of the Crown Prince. It was rumoured that Karikalan would never look at women and that he had vowed to remain unmarried throughout his life. But Karikalan spent most of his time in the ladies’ chambers in the Kadambur Palace. He was talking in a flirtatious tone to the women of the Royal Household. In particular he was praising Manimekalai’s natural gift of enthusiasm. Manimekalai too appeared to be deliriously happy since the arrival of the Crown Prince. Sambuvaraiyar naively thought that his daughter too had fallen for the Prince’s charm. He was pleased to see his daughter and the Crown Prince being happy in each other’s company. If his daughter married Karikalan she would become the Empress of the vast Chozha Kingdom. And the child born to her would succeed Karikalan to the Chozha throne. Whatever honour and glory that Malaiyaman was enjoying today would be his in the next generation. Why should I interfere with the Lady Luck who is eager to visit my Palace? Why should I stand in the way of my daughter’s glory? It was true that Sambuvaraiyar wanted to give his daughter’s hand to Madhuranthakan the heir apparent to the Chozha throne. But Madhuranthakan already had two wives. And one of his wives was the daughter of the Junior Pazhuvettaraiyar. He also had a son through her. So if Madhuranthakan was crowned the King, Pazhuvettaraiyar’s clan would come in the direct line of succession. Sambuvaraiyar’s daughter Manimekalai would be one of the thousands of maids in Thanjavur Palace. But if Manimekalai married Adithya Karikalan she would be the Empress of the Chozha Kingdom. Her son would be crowned the King after Karikalan. Again it was next to impossible to make Madhuranthakan the King. People were against him. And they would have to wage a war against Malaiyaman and Kodumbalur Chieftain to achieve the near impossible feat of making Madhuranthakan the Emperor. Even Madhuranthakan’s mother would oppose the move. Why should we get into that kind of a trouble where there was no gain for him or his family? On the other hand Adithya Karikalan’s coronation was a decided issue. It was not likely to be opposed. The only possible resistance would be the adamant attitude of Pazhuvettaraiyars. Of the two brothers, the elder one, at his age, was a slave to his young wife’s beauty. How long would he live, nobody knew. Why should Sambuvaraiyar undertake a risky venture relying only on the support of that old man? Yes, it was true that Sambuvaraiyar had pledged his support to Madhuranthakan. So what? Let me explore the ways of accomplishing my desire without violating the pledge. Madhuranthakan was a gullible person. It was easy even to make him refuse the throne. He did not even go to that extent. Enough if Madhuranthakan said that without his mother’s blessings he would not accept the Crown. Sambuvaraiyar’s mind had started thinking in these lines. That made him enthusiastically support the Pazhuvettaraiyar’s decision of going to Thanjavur to bring Madhuranthakan. Pazhuvettaraiyar’s absence would give Sambuvaraiyar opportunities for a “heart to heart” talk with Adithya Karikalan. Once he knew what was in the Crown Prince’s mind then he could devise his strategy accordingly. He hastened Pazhuvettaraiyar’s trip to Thanjavur and personally arranged a retinue to go with him. Pazhuvettaraiyar left for his long journey. Karikalan and his friends went for hunting. Sambuvaraiyar was even ready to send his daughter, Manimekalai, and her friends along with the hunting expedition. But Kandhanmaran who had been seeing things from a different perspective strongly objected to it. Kandhanmaran was shrewd enough to know that the attention Karikalan paid to Manimekalai was only on account of Nandini. That made him hate the Crown Prince even more. He could not explain the subtle relationship to his father. Hence he opted for the usual arguments - “What’s the use of girls while we are going on a hunting expedition? If they came with us, we will be spending most of our time worrying about their safety. Again, this is the Tamil month of Aippasi (October - November) Rains may come at any moment. . There might be floods. The ladies will be stranded.”  Sambuvaraiyar abandoned the idea of sending his daughter. Karikalan left for hunting along with his friends Parthibendran, Vandhiya Thevan, Kandhanmaran and a group of hunters. Sambuvaraiyar’s Palace now wore a deserted look. But for Sambuvarayar, there were no men in the palace. Nandini started to make her move. She spoke to Manimekalai. “Men were a nuisance to us when they were here. But if all of them are away then we start missing them. There is nothing to make fun of. It’s boring.”  “Yes, Akka. We too could have gone with them. I want to see hunting. I used to go with my father and my brother. But today Kandhanmaran was quite adamant in stopping us. I don’t know why. Perhaps he knows that you hate hunting and that was the reason for his ban.”  “Yes, Manimekalai. I don’t like hunting. I am allergic to blood. But that was not the reason for Kandhanmaran’s ban. He was particular in keeping you away from one of the guests. That was why he did not want us to come.”  Dimples appeared on Manimekalai’s cheeks. After some time she replied. “Let the men go to hell, Akka! Who cares! Who needs their company, anyway? But Akka, I have a plan. Why don’t we go to the Mandapam in the middle of the lake to have a swim?”  Nandini agreed. Manimekalai made the arrangements. On the eastern side of the gigantic Veeranarayana Lake there was a huge bank and seventy four canals that carry water from the lake to agricultural lands. There was no such bank on the Western Side. On the western side the water level was low and near the bank it was almost at the ground level. Further west were the dense forests. Near the western bank, where the water level was low, there were some small islets here and there. These islets were thick in vegetation. In one of these islets on the western side there were steps and a Mandapam. The women of the Kadambur Palace used to visit this place to have a bath and entertain themselves with water sports. To reach this place one had to go around the lake for about ten miles. Because of the distance and because of the fact that the place was reserved for the women of the royal household, people never came near that place. Nandini and Manimekalai got on a boat and rowed to this secluded place. There were two maids who did the rowing. They had even bought vessels and provisions for cooking. As soon as the boat reached the Mandapam the maids got down and started cooking. Nandini and Manimekalai sat on the steps to gossip about the members of the Royal household. Manimekalai was intelligent, talented and quite mischievous. She mimicked the voice of Pazhuvettaraiyar, Karikalan, Kandhanmaran, Parthibendran and Vandhiya Thevan. Nandini could not control her laugh. But Nandini’s mind was not there. It had drifted to a secret corner of her mind where something crucial was cooking. Suddenly Manimekalai stood up with a jolt. “Akka, we have not come for hunting. But you know hunting is coming towards  \\x0cus.”  She shouted while pulling out a knife from her waist. Nandini was shocked. She looked at the spot pointed out by Manimekalai. On a leaning branch of a large tree there was a leopard. It was looking at the two women as if it was making its mind whether to spring on them or not. They also heard the sound of horses galloping in water. Chapter 41 - Karikalan’s Murderous Frenzy  Adithya Karikalan had told his hosts that it had been long since he went for hunting and that he had almost forgotten the art of archery. But those who saw him hunting wild beasts on the banks of Veeranarayana Lake that day did not think so. Rabbits, deer, bears and leopards fell dead in quick succession unable to bear the onslaught of arrows that burst out from his bow. When there were no animals around, he aimed his arrows at the birds flying high in the sky. Eagles and falcons fell dead screaming. Karikalan was in a state of murderous frenzy. And the pace increased as time went on. His companions did not have much to do. As men and horses went through the forest making a huge noise the animals ran for shelter. That was the only help his companions provided for his hunting. He did not even let his companions shoot arrows at the animals that came to attack him. Once Kandhanmaran shot an arrow at the bear that just managed to narrowly miss Karikalan. Karikalan turned to his friend. “Kandhanmaran, are you trying to kill the bear or me?”  Kandhanmaran was furious. He never bent his bow thereafter. Everyone was exhausted when the sun was at its peak. All his companions wanted to rest for a while before returning to the palace. But Karikalan was driving his exhausted horse with the kind of fury no one could imagine. In the morning Kandhanmaran was riding close to the Crown Prince. But once  \\x0cKarikalan asked him “Are you trying to kill me?” he retreated and started riding with Parthibendra Pallavan. He started complaining to Parthibendran about the harsh words and the cruel behaviour of the Prince. Parthibendran did his best to pacify him. Vandhiya Thevan now approached Karikalan and was riding very close to him. Vandhiya Thevan did not have bow or arrows. He was not well-versed in archery. He had a spear. He never interfered with the Prince’s hunting. He was extremely watchful. He was ready to use his spear should an occasion arise. And till noon such an occasion did not present itself. Kandhanmaran meanwhile continued his complaint. “Is it not enough for the day? At this rate he will kill all the animals in the forest before the end of the day. Only the large forest at Kolli Hills will give him outlet for his frenzy. Why don’t you ask him to return? Why don’t you tell him to call it a day?”  “Thambi, something is troubling the Prince. It is not easy to give up a large empire. The Crown Prince perhaps is showing all his pent up fury on the hapless animals. In a way that’s good. If there had been no hunting he would have vented his feelings on you and me. Let’s keep quiet. Let us wait till he gets tired and says, “Enough for the day.”  At that time the whole forest was shaken by a frightening sound. It was the grunting sound of a wild animal. Kandhanmaran’s face went pale. “Oh My God! It’s a wild boar. Please ask the Prince to stop.”  \\x0c“It’s a boar, after all. Didn’t you see how the tigers and bears suffered from the Prince’s arrows?”  “You don’t know about wildlife in this area. The boars in this forest can even kill a tiger or a bear. They even attack an elephant. Horses can’t stand their ferocity even for a few seconds. The boar’s skin is so thick that arrows and spears will bounce off from their body. PRINCE, STOP! STOP! PLEASE STOP! DON’T GO AFTER THAT BOAR.”  There was a whirlwind in the bushes near them. Two wild boars which resembled elephant calves came out of the bushes. They saw the horses and the men riding them. “Careful. They are dangerous.” Kandhanmaran screamed. Meanwhile the professional hunters ran up to the place and started playing their drums furiously making awkward noises. The boars saw the circus. Perhaps they thought of their young ones. Perhaps they thought that their young ones might be in danger. Or they were frightened by the sound of the drums. They started to run off in opposite directions. Kandhanmaran saw them running. “My Lord, let them go. Let’s not follow them. We cannot follow a boar without  \\x0cthe help of five or six trained hunter dogs.”  Karikalan did not pay heed. He bent his bow and shot an arrow training his eyes on one of the boars. The arrow did not miss its mark. It stuck to the body of the boar. Karikalan let out a victorious roar. The next second the boar shook its body. The arrow fell down. The boar resumed its running. Kandhanmaran laughed. And it was like insulting the Crown Prince. Karikalan did not miss the insinuation. “Kandhanmaran! Vandhiya Thevan and I’ll go behind that boar. We’ll kill it and bring the body back here. You and Parthibendran go after the other boar. We shall not return to the Palace without killing these two animals. Challenge?”  He did not wait for Kandhanmaran’s response. He kicked his horse. It started to run. Vandhiya Thevan followed the Crown Prince. For a while they could trace the path of the wild boar. For the beast had crushed the bushes on the way and had left tell-tale evidence. They then encountered a canal. The canal was built as a kind of rain-harvesting mechanism. The canal carried the rain-water from the forest to the lake. The duo could not find out in which direction the boar went. Did it cross the canal and go deeper into the forest? Or did it run on the banks of the canal? They could see the huge Veeranarayana Lake through the canal. They could see a boat on the lake. They could also see that all the passengers on board were women. But they could not recognize them from that distance. At first it appeared that the boat was coming towards their direction. Then the boat turned and went towards an islet near the bank. After some time the boat disappeared from their view. “Vandhiya Theva, did you see that? Who were in that boat? I think all of them were women.”  “I too think so, Prince. But I don’t know who they are.”  “Perhaps the women are from Sambuvaraiyar’s household.”  “Quite possible. But why should they come this far?”  “You are right. It can’t be them. But are you sure that Pazhuvettaraiyar has left Kadambur?”  “I am sure, Your Highness. I saw the gates of Palace being opened in the morning and his leaving on an elephant’s back.”  “Did he go alone?”  “Yes, he did. The Junior Queen did not accompany the old man.”  “When are we going to see another warrior like him? You know my grandfather Malaiyaman too is a great warrior. But I’d rate him only next to Pazhuvettaraiyar.”  \\x0c“Your Highness, I’ve heard people talking about these old men. But I have seen your valour in the battlefield with my own eyes. I saw it in the Kadambur Palace as well. You made them all, young and old, shake in fear.”  “That’s true. I made that kind of a fuss for a specific reason. I wanted to drive that old man away so that I can do something which I’ve wanted to do for ages. The time has come now. But you know my mind and my body are trembling. You can never see a worse coward than me in the whole Chozha Kingdom.”  “Your Highness, I’ve been watching you since this morning. You don’t appear to be trembling in fear. On the other hand you made all those wild animals and the birds, why, even those who came with you tremble in fear.”  “Do you call that bravery? Do you think hunting is an act of valour? A hunting dog at times kills a leopard. A wild boar fights with the mighty elephant. Hunting is not act of valour. Listen, my dear friend, my conspiracy worked. Pazhuvettaraiyar has left Nandini alone. But I am still afraid of meeting her and talking to her.”  “I can understand, Prince. You had a soft corner for her all these years. But now you know that she is your own sister. She is now working with the conspirators of Pandya Kingdom. She is keen on destroying the entire Chozha clan. It is very difficult to discuss these things with her. I could not do that, Prince, though I had an opportunity to do so.”  “My dear friend, I was shocked by this new development. I could not believe even now that she could be my sister. But when I think of what happened in the past it looks quite credible. In those days there was a screen between me and  \\x0cNandini. Queen Mother - I mean Sembian Madevi - was particular that I should not have anything to do with Nandini. But she never told us the whole truth. If only she had, we could have avoided many complications.”  “Even the Queen Mother might not know, Your Highness. She might have thought of Nandini as an orphan girl. She might not have known that Nandini is the daughter of Emperor Sundara Chozhan.”  \\x0cChapter 42 - “She Is Not A Woman”  The Crown Prince was lost in thoughts. Childhood memories flooded his mind. For a while, they made his mind boil and then disappeared giving place to other memories. Karikalan forcefully controlled those thoughts and as a sign of victory let out a long sigh. He spoke to Vandhiya Thevan in a calm voice. “Let bygones be bygones. Let’s just talk about the future. That was the reason I pulled you out of the crowd. Looks like we have lost the bet, for the wild boar is nowhere to be seen. Vallavaraiya, Let us use this time to discuss what should be done now and how should we do it. I shudder to think how I am going to talk to Nandini about the blood relationship I share with her. I can’t even look at her face now. When I accidentally see her face she retains the expression she had when she pleaded for the life of Veerapandiyan. Her eyes seem at that time like a sharp sword which pierces my heart. My heart bleeds when I think that my own sister, my own blood, out of her love for Veerapandiyan so passionately pleaded for his life. What do you think Vandhiya Theva? Do you think she does not know the truth yet? Do you think that she still does not know that she is the Emperor’s daughter and my dear sister?”  “My Lord, if she had known she would not have joined hands with the conspirators of Pandya Kingdom. If only she had known that the Emperor is her father she would not have let a child sit on a throne and crowned him as the King of Pandyas and the Emperor of the Chozha Kingdom. She would not have drawn her sword and would not have sworn to save the Crown and the throne even at the cost of her life. I saw all these things in Thiruppurambayam War Memorial at midnight on that fateful day. Yes, my Lord, that is not hearsay; I saw it with my own eyes.”  “I am surprised why she let you live after you had seen all those things.”  \\x0c“There is nothing odd about it, my Lord. It might be due to the natural compassion in any woman’s heart.”  “Vandhiya Theva, you are innocent. You do not know about the ways of the world. You don’t know the deceit and treachery that can lie in a woman’s heart. I don’t know why she let you go alive. But I know intuitively why she sent a secret message to me to come here to Kadambur.”  “Why, Prince?”  “She wants to kill me. She wants to take revenge for the death of Veerapandiyan. “  “Your Highness, Princess Kunthavai and the Chief Minister sent me here precisely to avert that kind of a catastrophe. I told you several times not to go to Kadambur. But you never listened to me, Prince.”  “Vandhiya Theva, Kunthavai and the Chief Minister are very intelligent people. But even then they cannot block the hands of Destiny. I think Destiny wants to vindicate what the astrologers told about my brother Arulmozhi - that he will be the Emperor of the three worlds. And perhaps that was the reason Destiny pulled me up here. Who knows what will happen to me here? Vandhiya Theva, did you see Kandhanmaran shooting the arrow from behind? Did he want to hit the bear or me?”  “I didn’t see, my Lord. But I don’t think Kandhanmaran will stoop to the level of  \\x0csuch a blatant betrayal. I don’t think Kandhanmaran will kill his guest, and that too the Emperor’s son and that too from behind. No, he won’t do that, Your Highness. Well, I don’t have any regards for his intelligence. He was slain and was lying unconscious. It was I who carried him from there and saved him. Because I was the first person he saw after he opened his eyes he thought that I was the one who stabbed him. Since that day he considers me his first enemy and has been hostile to me. He may not be smart; but he is not treacherous, my Lord. He could not have done that.”  “My dear friend, you don’t know the seductive powers of a beautiful woman. It can even make the best of men to betray.”  “My Lord, I too know something about the seductive charms of a woman. But never in my life will I betray any one.”  “Oh! But Manimekalai is a good girl. She will never induce you to do an act of betrayal.”  “I am not talking of Manimekalai, My Lord. Do you think fireflies will appear attractive to a man who has seen the Full Moon itself?”  “Whom do you call as Full Moon?”  “Please bear with me, my Lord. I am referring to the Princess at Pazhaiyaarai.”  “ Upstart! You naughty boy! The greatest kings on earth are longing for  \\x0cKunthavai’s hand. You should not even think of my sister in that manner.”  “Prince, the Full Moon gives its rays to the Emperors of the world. Even the poor and homeless delight in the rays of the moon. Who can prevent them?”  “You are right. There is no point in getting angry with you. In fact I intentionally sent you to my sister with a message. I think she must be pleased with you. Otherwise you won’t talk like this. But don’t share this with Parthibendra Pallavan. His long term dream is to become the son-in-law of the Chozha Emperor and thereby become the King of Thondai Mandalam.”  “That must have been the situation some time before. Not now, Your Highness. Right now Parthibendran and Kandhanmaran are at the feet of Nandini Devi. Her slightest whim is a divine command to them. They are ready to give their lives for her.”  “I have been watching that development, my friend. In fact I am a little afraid of those two people now.”  “Considering the developments I think it is high time that you meet Nandini and tell her truth.”  “My dear friend, I don’t think I’d have the courage to do that. Why don’t you speak to her on my behalf?”  “She won’t believe me, my Lord. Once I deceived her and went away from her  \\x0chold. So she might think even this is a kind of deception.”  “But tell me how I can meet Nandini alone. She is always in the ladies’ chambers.”  “I can help you, Prince. Through Manimekalai. Leave it to me.”  “Looks like Manimekalai will dance to your tunes. That’s a good development. If I manage to get her married to you, I’ll be happy.”  “No, my Lord. I consider Manimekalai as my sister. I want her to marry somebody far higher in stature than me.”  “I don’t get it.”  “That’s news to me, my Lord. I am sure that the girl has reserved a soft corner for herself in the heart of the Crown Prince of Chozha Kingdom. Honestly, Prince, I talked about Manimekalai as firefly compared to the Full Moon of Kunthavai. But the truth is that no one in this world with the only exception of Princess Kunthavai can be equal to Manimekalai in intelligence and qualities. If you married Manimekalai all our problems will be solved. Sambuvaraiyar and Kandhanmaran will come to our side. Pazhuvettaraiyars will be isolated. Nandini too will be weakened. Madhuranthakan cannot even dream of becoming the King. We will crush the conspiracy of the Chieftains; we can destroy the diabolic plans of the body-guards of Pandyas.”  \\x0c“Thambi, you are right. But I have not come to Kadambur to get married. I think we are caught. I am sure Pazhuvettaraiyar is going to come back to Kadambur with a big army.”  “Then why don’t we send word to your grandfather, the King of Thirukkovalur to come with an army? Should we not be prepared for such an eventuality?”  “I am thinking of that. At times I can’t control my temper. I want to raze this Kadambur Palace to the ground and hang all those bloody conspirators at the palace gates. I am controlling myself only because of my father. If only you had brought him to Kanchi... “  “Prince, even to deliver your letter... Oh My God... that was the hardest mission I ever handled.”  “Yes. The Emperor is virtually held as a hostage by the Pazhuvettaraiyars. I have built a Golden Palace for my parents at Kanchi. The Palace is vacant; only bats are living there now. I don’t think I will have the blessing of receiving my parents in the Palace when I am alive. I don’t think I’ll go out of Kadambur alive.”  “I am worried, my Lord. No I am frightened. As I hear you talk I think it is all the more necessary to summon the armed forces of King Malaiyaman.”  “I am thinking of deputing you for that purpose.”  \\x0c“I am sorry, Your Highness. I have strict orders from your sister never to leave you alone even for a second.”  “You have been true to your orders till now.”  “Parthibendra Pallavan does not have much to do in Kadambur Palace. He finds it difficult to while away his time.”  “You are right. Every second he does not see Nandini is like a century to him. I never thought Parthibendran will become a slave to a woman’s beauty. Let us send him to Malaiyaman.”  “That’s the right thing to do, My Lord.”  “If something happens in his absence you are there to protect me.”  “Prince, whether I am there or not, whether anybody is there or not to guard you, I am sure no one in this world will dare to hurt you. Those old warriors were talking derisively about you in your absence; but they have been trembling in fear ever since they saw you.”  “Thambi, I am not afraid of any man who wants to fight with me with a sword face to face. I am frightened of those like Kandhanmaran who want to kill me from behind.”  \\x0c“But my Lord, you have again started accusing Kandhanmaran.”  “Listen, Thambi. I am afraid of the evil in a woman’s heart. As I think of what a woman’s heart can hold I tremble in fear. When she sees me in that mysterious way I feel a spear is piercing my chest. When I think of her I become weak in my legs.”  “My Lord, yes, you should fear Nandini. I am not denying that. I know the kind of hatred that resides in her heart. When I think of why she let me go on that day I am afraid there might be a treacherous plan behind that seemingly innocent act. But all these fears arise because she does not know the truth. If you tell her that you are her brother then all our fears and worries will go away.”  “Do you think so, Vallavaraiya? You are smart. But you are too innocent to know how a woman’s mind will think. If Nandini knows that she is Sundara Chozhan’s daughter her hatred will become a hundred fold. Even if we all promise to make her the Empress of Chozha Kingdom she won’t be pacified.”  “Prince, if that is what you think, then leave the job to me. I’ll reveal the secret to Nandini Devi and try to pacify her.”  “Even you can’t do that, my friend. No one can assuage her hard feelings. Listen. If our Chozha clan has to be saved either I have to die. Or she has to die. Or both have to die. Let me kill her with the same sword which I used on Veerapandiyan.”  “What is this, Prince? Why do you talk like that?”  \\x0c“Vandhiya Theva, it is all right to kill a person to save a Kingdom. What if the person killed happens to be a woman? What if the woman happens to be my own sister? In fact Nandini is not a woman. She is a devil in the guise of a woman. And if we let her live the great Chozha clan which has been flourishing since the time of Vijayalaya Chozha will go to dogs. Oh My God! What is that?”  Adithya Karikalan was startled by the sudden noise. There was some rustling sound coming from the bushes nearby. It appeared that somebody was fighting there. They rode to that place. It was a very rare sight. A wild boar was fighting with a leopard. “Aha! The man we have been searching for is here,” shouted Karikalan. He was obviously referring to the wild boar which they were chasing a little while ago. “I think the leopard will finish him. We won’t have anything to do.”  “Do you think so? Just watch the fun.”  It was an interesting sight. The Leopard pounced on the boar and was trying to kill it with its teeth and claws. But the thick skin of the boar did not yield to the leopard’s attacks. Soon the boar got the upper hand. It ran towards the leopard and with its short horns knocked down to the ground and gave hell to the wild cat. The long teeth of the boar tore the skin of the leopard. When finally the boar knocked it down for a second time the leopard lay on the ground dead. “Thambi, the leopard is dead. The boar will now turn towards us. Let us be prepared.”  Karikalan loaded his bow with an arrow and aimed at the boar. The arrow hit the neck of the boar. The boar shook his body. The arrow fell down. It turned around to look at the two horses and the riders. Then it saw the fallen leopard. The boar was sure no harm would come from the wild cat. It now sprang on the horses with enormous ferocity. Before Karikalan could load his bow with an arrow the boar attacked his horse. The horse was overwhelmed by the sudden attack causing it to shift its hind legs. They were caught in the roots of a tree. The horse could no longer sustain its balance and it fell down. Karikalan was trapped under the horse. The boar retreated a few steps and went for the fallen horse with even greater ferocity. Chapter 43 - Where Is The Leopard? Vandhiya Thevan was quick to find out that Adithya Karikalan was in danger. In a flash he rode towards the wild boar and inserted his spear into its thick skin. The spear was stuck. The boar shook itself violently and turned around to look at the aggressor. Vandhiya Thevan lost the grip of the handle. Soon the spear fell off from the body of the beast. The boar now turned towards Vandhiya Thevan. It was only then that he realised that he was trapped. His horse could not withstand the onslaught. He was unarmed. The only weapon he carried, a spear, was no longer with him. The Prince was still caught under his horse and was trying to come out. The only way out for Vandhiya Thevan was to grab the branch of a tree without getting down from the horse. After having escaped so many great dangers in the recent past Vandhiya Thevan detested being killed by a wild boar. Thank God there was a low lying branch nearby. Vandhiya Thevan sprang to the branch from the horse. He held the branch with all his strength and climbed on to the branch. At the same time the boar attacked his horse. The horse lost its balance and was about to fall down. It somehow managed to avoid the fall and run away. Karikalan was still trapped under his horse. Vandhiya Thevan was dangerously perched on the tree-branch. The boar stood between the two men looking at them alternately. It was perhaps making a judgment as to whom should it attack first. The Prince had not yet come out from under his horse. Even if he did, whether he would be  \\x0cable to handle the boar without any weapon or help was a big question. Of course he had his bow and arrows. But it may take some time to load the arrow in the bow and shoot. The boar might take advantage of the time-gap and might attack him. Again the Prince might have been seriously injured. So the best strategy available to Vandhiya Thevan now was to distract the boar and attract it towards him, so that the Prince could buy some precious time. Vandhiya Thevan thought fast. He made several quick decisions. He shook the branch he was sitting on and made some strange sounds with his mouth with a view to distract the boar. His strategy worked. The boar ran ferociously towards the tree. “Let it come. Let the wild beast hit against the strong tree trunk.” Vandhiya thought with a glee. His happiness did not last long. The branch on which he was sitting cracked with a huge noise. Oh My God! What is this? If I were to fall along with the branch, the boar’s teeth will tear me apart the very next second. I have to get hold of another branch. NOW! Vandhiya Thevan tried to grab another branch. The branch was a little away. Only one of his hands could reach the branch. The branch was frail. His hand started to slip. His legs were dangling in the air. Oh My God! There is no other way. I have to fall down to instantaneous death. But I am happy that I could save the Crown Prince in my dying moments. Karikalan is likely to tell this to Kunthavai. She will be happy. And she is likely  \\x0cto shed a few drops of tears for me. That is more than enough for me. Vandhiya Thevan heard a terrible noise. His hands slipped from the branch. He closed his eyes and fell down with a noisy thud. And soon became unconscious. When he came back he saw Adithya Karikalan sprinkling water on him. He sat up. “My God! Prince, you are alive!”  “Yes, I am, thanks to your help.”  “What happened to the boar?”  “It’s there.”  Vandhiya Thevan looked in that direction. The boar lay dead. Vandhiya Thevan looked at it for some time. “Your Highness, such a small animal gave us so much trouble! Whatever Kandhanmaran said about the wild boars of this area is true. But tell me, my Lord, how did you manage to kill the beast?”  \\x0c“I didn’t kill. It was you. And your spear.”  Vandhiya Thevan was puzzled. “You have put my spear to the best possible use. But I didn’t do anything, my Lord. I am ashamed that I could not help when you were in danger.”  “Didn’t you shake the branch and shout at the beast? I came out from under my horse at that time. I took your spear. I vented all my pent up fury on the boar. Poor beast! As soon as the spear hit its body it made a terrible sound. I thought I’d go deaf hearing that sound. But it did not die of the spear alone. You fell from the tree. You fell right on the boar. The beast died of shock.”  Adithya Karikalan laughed. Vandhiya Thevan joined him. “Because I fell on the boar I was not injured. You know, my Lord, our mythology tells the story of our kind Lord who took the form of a boar to kill a demon. Till now I could not believe that. But after seeing the antics of this wild boar our mythology seems credible to me. Oh My God! What a ferocious beast!”  “Don’t judge the incarnation of Varaha (boar) by this little beast. In the forest ranges of Vindhya in the North there lives a boar with a single horn. It’s as huge as an elephant. If this boar were to be of that size and if it had hit the tree with all its force just imagine what would have happened to the tree?”  \\x0c“The tree would have been uprooted. The spear you threw would have been broken. We would have been killed. That would have saved the trouble for the enemies of the Chozha clan.”  “Thambi, tell me the truth. When my horse fell down you threw the spear. Was it for the boar or for me?”  Vandhiya Thevan was furious. “My Lord, is that you who are asking this question? If you don’t trust me you could have killed me. Why did you kill the boar and save me?”  “Yes, yes. I should not doubt your intentions. If you had not shaken the tree branch and made that terrible noise the boar would have killed me. But when you threw the spear I had my doubts. You know nowadays I suspect everything and everybody. I can’t shake off the thought that the Lord of Death is constantly following me. I thought that the Lord of Death came in the form of a boar.”  “That’s a good sign, my Lord. Death that followed you is dead. All our worries are gone. And we have won in our challenge with Kandhanmaran. Let us drag this boar. Shall we leave now?”  “What’s the need to hurry? I am tired. Why don’t we relax here for a while?”  “I am hearing for the first time that you are tired. Yes, you should be, my Lord, for you were caught under the horse for a long time.”  \\x0c“That’s nothing. More than my body, my mind is tired. Should we go back in the way we came and join those idiots? Why don’t we cross the lake and go to the other bank?”  “My God! How can we swim across this lake which resembles an ocean? After saving me from the boar you want to have me killed in this lake?”  “I now remember - you can’t swim. I too can’t swim across such a huge lake. If we get a boat it’d be easy. Didn’t we see a boat a little while ago? It must be somewhere near on this bank. Why don’t we go look for it?”  “Our horses? Should we leave them as prey for the wild animals of the forest?”  Vandhiya Thevan first spoke in a teasing tone. Then he remembered something and stood up startled. “OH MY GOD! WHERE THE HELL IS THE LEOPARD?”  “It has completely slipped from my mind. It should be hiding somewhere. The Lord of Death might come in the form of a leopard as well. To kill me here.”  The two men looked around. Vandhiya Thevan shouted after some time. “There!”  \\x0cThere was a canal which fed water into the lake. The canal became gradually narrow as it approached the lake. In the narrow section of the canal a tree had fallen and it kind of acted as a bridge between the two banks of the canal. The leopard was walking over the fallen tree. The same thought flashed in the minds of both the men. “My God! The women in the boat!” The two men shouted simultaneously. “They must have got down at the island near the canal.” - Vandhiya Thevan. “Wounded leopards are very dangerous.”  “Let’s kill the leopard and take it along with the boar.”  “How can we cross this canal? We can walk over the fallen tree; but not our horses.”  “There is not much water flowing in the canal. We can get down and walk through the canal along with the horses.”  Meanwhile Karikalan’s horse had gone near Vandhiya Thevan’s horse. It appeared as if the horses, like their Masters, were exchanging notes in their own horse language about the dangers they faced. The men mounted on the horses. They led the horses to the canal. The water level was low. But it was quite  \\x0cmuddy. The horses had a hard time crossing the canal. Vandhiya Thevan thought of the quick sand in Kodikkarai. “Compared to those death traps this is a breeze.” He described them to the Crown Prince. “My dear friend! You are worried about the quick sand outside. What do you think of the mud in the minds of people? If someone gets caught in the quick sand of evil thoughts it will be very difficult for him to come out of it.”  Vandhiya Thevan pitied the Prince. Poor soul, his mind was muddy as the canal, he thought. The horses reached the other bank of the canal after a great deal of trouble. The two men looked carefully in all the directions before riding on. Karikalan was ready with his bow and arrows. Vandhiya Thevan was ready to throw the spear on the leopard. Suddenly a woman’s shrill voice was heard over the usual sounds of the forest “Amma! Leopard! Danger! Amma! Leopard!”  When Manimekalai saw the leopard on the tree branch one of the maids who was cooking in the Mandapam also saw the animal and shrieked. The two men heard the noise. Their hairs stood straight. They rode fast in the direction of the voice. As soon as they negotiated the turn they were shocked by what they saw. Nandini and Manimekalai were climbing down the steps to bath in the lake. At  \\x0cthe same time the leopard was slowly climbing up the branches of the tree. The leopard was badly hurt in its fight with the wild boar. Survival should have been topmost in the mind of the jungle cat. But nobody else knew what was in its mind. Karikalan and Vandhiya Thevan thought that the leopard was going to pounce on the two women soon. Vandhiya Thevan was hesitant to use the spear. If it missed the mark and fell on the ladies.... it might kill them. Karikalan was not hesitant. He loaded his bow with an arrow and aimed a shot at the leopard. The arrow landed on the leopard’s stomach. The leopard roared and pounced on the two women. Nobody knew what happened. The leopard and the two women were not to be seen. A few minutes later all three appeared in different places in the lake. A part of the lake became red mixed with blood. Chapter 44 - Love And Revenge  The friends watched the events unfolding before them with a sense of awe and wonder. They jumped off their horses. They came running to the banks of the lake. By that time the leopard had gone deeper into the water. From the way the leopard floated on the surface of water it was clear that it was dead. The men badly wanted to know if the women were hurt. The two men sprang into the water and went in search of the women. Vandhiya Thevan was cautious. He swam towards Manimekalai. He was afraid of going near Nandini. Manimekalai was not hurt. She had fallen into water because of the shock caused by the leopard’s sudden fall. As her fall was quite sudden she was gasping for breath. She was not hurt. When she saw Vandhiya Thevan coming near her she became ecstatic and closed her eyes unable to control her happiness. Hence she did not know that Karikalan stopped Vandhiya Thevan by holding his hands and asked him to go towards Nandini. Karikalan now swam towards Manimekalai. Poor girl, Manimekalai, she did not open her eyes till Karikalan hugged her, lifted her and then carried her to the shore and gently placed her down. Only when the Crown Prince placed his fingers beneath her nose to check whether she was breathing she slowly opened her eyes. She thought that her saviour was her beloved Vandhiya Thevan. And she tried her best to express all her love and gratitude through her first glance. The moment she recognized the Crown Prince she stood up and moved away from him. The obvious disappointment in her face did not escape the attention of the Crown Prince. He laughed. “What is this Manimekalai? Why do you hate me so much?”  “No. I don’t hate you, Prince. How can a girl not feel shy when some stranger touches her?”  “Silly girl! You have made me a stranger. Don’t you know that your people are planning to get us married?”  “Till their plans materialize you will be a stranger to me.”  “But you can tell me whether you like this alliance or not.”  The Princess of Kadambur thought for a while. “Your Highness! You are a descendant of the famous Chozha clan. You know the ways of the world. Tell me whether it is proper to talk like this to a small girl? Shouldn’t you talk to my father?”  “Listen Girl, if your father agrees, will you?”  “If my father agrees to the match and then he asks me I’ll give a suitable answer to him. I feel very shy to talk to you on this subject. You saved me from the leopard. You saved me from drowning. As an expression of gratitude I have been patient till now.”  \\x0cKarikalan laughed again. “Manimekalai, you are very smart. You are a deep person. Even then you are disappointed. But don’t try to deceive me.”  “Oh My God! What are you talking, Your Highness! How can a small girl like me deceive the Crown Prince? What for? And pray, how?”  “Why are you beating around the bush? If Vandhiya Thevan had carried you ashore instead of me will you be using the same harsh words against him? You closed your eyes thinking that Vandhiya Thevan is coming to save you. You opened your eyes hoping to see only him. And poor girl, you were disappointed.”  Manimekalai was shy at first. And then afraid. She took some time to gather herself. “Prince, you know what is in my mind. Then why are you still testing the waters?”  “Manimekalai, I know what’s in your mind. I also know what’s in Vandhiya Thevan’s mind as well. I think that Vandhiya Thevan does not deserve your love. See there. Vandhiya Thevan and Nandini are playing games of love. See the happiness in Nandini’s face.”  \\x0cManimekalai looked in the direction pointed out by the Crown Prince. Manimekalai’s mind which was as white as milk till then was poisoned by feelings of envy. Vandhiya Thevan and Nandini were in conversation. The leopard’s claw had hurt Nandini’s shoulders. She was bleeding. But unlike Manimekalai Nandini did not make any attempt to close her eyes. She did not take any effort to free herself from the hands of Vandhiya Thevan. But Vandhiya Thevan felt as if he were carrying a live flame and was in a hurry to let her down. Nandini had remained in water for some time. And yet her body was hot. A vague fear crept into the mind of Vandhiya Thevan. He was shivering. Nandini smiled. “Why are you trembling in fear? Did you mistake me for the leopard? Or perhaps you wanted to save the leopard; and by mistake you saved me. A case of mistaken identity. I hope you are regretting your decision.”  “Please, Devi, please don’t use harsh words on me. I am shaken because I was forced to touch you and carry you.”  “Guilty minds get shaken. That’s the rule.”  “I am innocent, Devi.”  “Are you sure? You sought my help to get into Thanjavur Fort. I gave my signet  \\x0cring to you. Then you entered my private chambers by stealth. I saved you from near death. And pray, how did you repay your gratitude? You ran away from me. You simply vanished without caring to take leave of me. You promised to come to me after meeting the Princess at Pazhaiyaarai. And you went back on your word. Do you still consider yourself innocent?”  “Yes, I accept the charges levelled against me. But I have my reasons, Devi. I am after all a paid servant. I am bound by the orders of Adithya Karikalan. And if you consider my circumstances you’ll never accuse me, Devi.”  “Yes. Even to save a woman from the mouth of a leopard you need to have the orders of your Boss, Karikalan. I was watching. The Prince showed an unusual interest in rescuing Manimekalai. I think he would have been glad if I had drowned. And without knowing what is there in the mind of your employer you have saved me.”  “Please, Devi. Please don’t talk like that. The Crown Prince has come all the way from Kanchi because of the message you sent to him.”  “But you came running to block his coming here. You came with a message from Princess Kunthavai. But you failed in your grand mission. Remember whenever you interfere with my work it will be a failure for you.”  Nandini’s words confused Vandhiya Thevan. He was dying to know the real meaning of her words. So he examined her face for clues. Nandini’s face was devoid of any expression but for her usual bland smile. Nandini continued. “Your guilt is evident from your face. On that fateful New Moon night you were caught by my men. If I had half-winked my eyes you would have been killed in no time. I forgot the past and did my best to save you. And you never cared to thank me for that that. I’ve never seen such an ungrateful creature on earth.”  “I promise, Devi, my heart is full of gratitude for you.”  “I have been in this town for several days. And you never met me even once to express that gratitude. How can I believe you?”  “I thought of meeting you in person to convey the feelings of gratitude. But, Devi, the circumstances were not favourable.”  “You did not do anything to create favourable circumstances. You could have at least given me a sign, a glance, a look or some signal. You never did that. You never even turned to look at me.”  “Devi, you are the wife of Chancellor of Exchequer of the Chozha Kingdom.”  “Now you are teasing me. You are insinuating that I am married to an old man!”  “Not at all, Devi. If I tease you I’ll go to hell.”  \\x0c“No need for that now. Whatever it is don’t mention that I am the wife of Pazhuvettaraiyar. I am not his wife.”  “Oh My God! What are you saying?”  “Nothing but the bitter truth. If a girl is forcibly abducted and brought home will she become the abductor’s wife by default?”  “Devi, you are a girl from Tamilnadu. I am sure you won’t do anything that goes against the rules of virtue applicable to women.”  “Yes, I know those rules. If a Tamil woman loses her heart to a man she will consider him and only him as her husband. A forced marriage will never bind her.”  “But ... but... you... Devi... “  “I know what you are coming to. How did I consent to a forced marriage with Pazhuvettaraiyar? It was for an important reason. There is another special trait of Tamilnadu women. They will never rest till they have avenged the injustice meted out to them. You did not help me to find my love; please help me at least to seek revenge.”  Nandini’s last words tore Vandhiya Thevan’s heart. He felt as if he had been hit by a lightning. He was in a state of shock. “Devi! Devi! What is this? What is the connection between me and your love? What is the connection between love and revenge?”  “There is a connection. But right now I don’t have the time to explain. See there. The Prince and Manimekalai are coming towards us. If you come to my room by midnight tomorrow I’ll tell you everything.”  “How it is possible, Devi? You are in the highly guarded ladies’ chamber. How can I come there alone? And that too at midnight?”  “Didn’t you escape from the same ladies chambers once? Why can’t you use the same way? Of course only if you want to; only if you have the will to come.”  Vandhiya Thevan was in a state of perfect shock now. But Nandini’s face did not show any expression other than her usual seductive smile. Chapter 45 - “You Are My Sister”  Karikalan and Manimekalai reached Vandhiya Thevan and Nandini. The Prince was looking at Vandhiya Thevan till he reached the place. Only then did he see Nandini. He saw red lines on her cheek and shoulder. He saw blood. “Oh My God! Were you hurt by the bloody leopard?”  “Yes, Your Highness. But the damned animal could only hurt my body. Not my mind.”  The words went deep into the heart of the Crown Prince. Before he could respond Manimekalai went near Nandini and spoke with trepidation. “Yes, Akka! The wounds appear deep. Thank God, I have brought some ointment. Come with me. I’ll apply it. You will be fine soon.”  “My dearest sister, I am used to being hurt. I have sustained much deeper wounds which have healed in the course of time. But tell me do you have any ointment for the wounds in one’s heart.”  “Sure, Akka. I do have. Come with me.” Manimekalai held Nandini’s hand and  \\x0cvirtually dragged her to the Mandapam. The Prince and Vandhiya Thevan followed them maintaining a respectable distance. They sat on a marble bench beneath a huge mango tree near the Mandapam. “Prince, the sooner we get out of this place the better for us. If we stay here any longer Kandhanmaran or his father might think ill of us.”  “Let them think whatever they want to. They cannot kill us for this indiscretion, right? It is enough if these women do not think ill of us. Let’s wait till they come back. We’ll take leave of them and go.”  A few minutes later Nandini and Manimekalai returned. They had changed. Nandini’s wounds were covered by a dark paste. “We are waiting to take leave of you.”  “It’s late in the afternoon. Having come thus far and having saved us from danger it is but proper that you should have lunch with us. If I let you go then Sambuvaraiyar’s daughter will never forgive me.”  “We’ll stay but on one condition. Manimekalai has applied some ointment on your wounds. She told me that she had some ointment for the wounds of the heart as well. If you promise to tell us about that magical ointment we’ll stay back. “  \\x0c“Why should we ask her? Can’t we make a guess?”  “Perhaps she talks of time which kind of heals all the wounds in the heart.”  “No, it can’t be. There are some wounds which even time can’t heal.”  Vandhiya Thevan intervened. “There is an excellent ointment for women. That’s called tears.”  Nandini retorted. “The Prince of Vallam was perhaps waiting for an opportunity to insult women. But what he says is not right. With some kind of wounds women even lose their capacity to shed tears. Then how will it be useful as a medicine?”  “Well, Devi, if you think we are not right, tell us what you think is right.”  “Why not? My dear sister, the ointment you referred goes to the heart through one’s ears. I am sure you allude to music that comes from Yazh, the flute and from a sweet human voice. Am I right?”  \\x0c“You are, Akka. But how did you know?”  “Didn’t I tell you that I am a sorceress? I have magical powers. I can divine what is there in the mind of others. But, do you two accept the power of music to heal the wounds in one’s heart?”  “We do. I also accept my defeat in not being able to guess that. I now remember what Kandhanmaran told about his sister Manimekalai - that she can play the Yazh very well.”  “That is how a brother should be. Unless he sings the praises of his sister at least once the day is wasted for him. Yes, whatever he says about Manimekalai’s musical talents is true. She has brought the instrument with her. Thank God she is not forced to display her talents before somebody like me - you know I am almost stone-deaf. Gentlemen, you saved us from being devoured by the leopard. Please give us an opportunity to express our gratitude. You should have lunch with us. And stay with us to enjoy Princess Manimekalai’s musical performance.”  Vandhiya Thevan gave a secret signal to the Crown Prince not to accept the invitation. But the Crown Prince did not notice him at all. “We are ready to do whatever the Princesses want us to do.” - The Crown Prince was enthusiastic. “Manimekalai, your dream has come true. Please have a look at the cooking arrangements. You have to hasten your cooks. We can’t keep these men waiting for long.”  \\x0cManimekalai ran towards the place where the maids were busy cooking. Vandhiya Thevan stood up and looked around. Nandini saw him. “Didn’t I tell you that I have the powers to divine what’s there in others’ minds? I want to test my powers now. Shall I tell you what’s going on in the mind of the Vallam Prince?”  Karikalan smiled at her. “Please.”  “He thinks that it was a great blunder to have killed the leopard and saved these two women. He thinks it would have been much better if we two had gone into the leopard’s stomach.”  Karikalan laughed. “My dear friend, is she right?”  “No, Your Highness. I never thought like that. But I have to give it to this noble lady that I was thinking about the leopard and these two women. I was  \\x0cwondering how the leopard managed to live after being caught by these women.”  “What happened to you, Thambi? Why are you blabbering? Is it alive? Again? Didn’t we see the dead body floating on water?”  The Crown Prince stood up. “Look there, Your Highness.”  From where they stood they could see the water-body between the branches of the trees. The boat used by the women was tied to the tree. The leopard was trying to get into the boat. Karikalan smiled as he spoke. “Aha! The leopard has a strong will. Looks like it is not destined to die.”  “Come, Prince, let’s go and kill the leopard. A wounded leopard is dangerous.”  “Brave Warrior of the Vana Clan, does a wounded leopard require two great warriors? I’ll call Manimekalai. She has a small knife in her hand. And that is more than enough to kill the beast.”  \\x0c“See my friend, the Queen of Pazhuvur has high regards for our valour. Do you think I should also come along? Aren’t you enough?”  “Or shall I send Manimekalai?” - Nandini asked. Vandhiya Thevan murmured:  “Yes, you can send her. But the problem is that she might apply some ointment and revive the animal. “  “What are you thinking?” The Crown Prince asked Vandhiya Thevan. “I am thinking of bringing the head of the wounded leopard and place it at the feet of the Pazhuvur Queen. Let me see at least if that makes her happy.”  Vandhiya Thevan walked away with these words. “Did you hear what the ruffian said? Do you think it requires much valour to behead a wounded leopard?”  Karikalan started to laugh at his own joke. He stopped after seeing the expression on Nandini’s face. “You are the best person to give an opinion on that.” Nandini’s words were very sharp. She probably alluded to the Crown Prince beheading Veerapandiyan when he was wounded and helpless. Karikalan told her in a choked voice. “Nandini I came here only because you sent message through Kandhanmaran. Otherwise I would not have come at all.”  “You acceded to my request at least now. Thanks a lot.”  “I thought that you had forgotten the past. And that was why you invited me here.”  “How can I forget the past, Prince? Tell me have you forgotten?”  “Yes, I too can’t. You were in tears. You begged a boon from me. I brutally refused. I was in a state of frenzy at that time. No, I have not forgotten anything. But tell me why did you ask me to come here?”  “Prince, you have not visited Thanjavur for the past three years. You have not seen your sick father.”  “He is not only my father but... “  \\x0c“Yes, I know. He is also the father of Princess Kunthavai as well as Ponniyin Selvan. But your father misses you a lot. Somebody has told the Emperor that I am the reason for your not coming to the capital. The Emperor hates me because of that and has not seen me even once. You have done enough harm to me, Prince. Why do you want to add this blame also to my account?”  “But that is the truth. I did not come to Thanjavur because of you.”  “Then let me leave Thanjavur immediately. You come to the town, become the next Emperor and... “  “That will never happen, Nandini. I am not keen on the Chozha Throne. Let Madhuranthakan be crowned the King. Let him rule the Kingdom.”  “Prince, you know Madhuranthakan very well. He cannot govern this huge Empire.”  “So what? The Pazhuvettaraiyars are ready and willing to help him. And you are there as well.”  “I now know what’s in your mind. Let me go out of Pazhuvur Palace. Let me go out of Thanjavur. You please come... “  “No! No! Not at all! You got me all wrong. I don’t have any desire to become the King. I have done enough harm to you in the past. I am not planning to hurt  \\x0cyou anymore. Let me not drive you out of the Pazhuvur Palace and add that to the list of heinous sins I have committed against you.”  “Prince, why can’t we both live in Thanjavur? That is a large town. Don’t you think there will not be enough room for both of us in the capital city? Ok, there is no need for us to meet.”  “Yes, there may not be any necessity for us to meet. But how are we going to avoid the thoughts in our mind? You told me a little while ago that you can’t forget the past. You also spoke about the wound in your heart. I too have a wound in my heart. And I can’t forget the past.”  “You may not be able to forget; can’t you at least forgive? Can’t you forgive me?”  “Nandini, you never did anything which requires my forgiveness. I was the one who wronged you. I am the one who should seek your forgiveness. Even when I left Kanchi I had the idea of seeking your pardon. But what I heard on the way made me totally unfit even to be pardoned by you.”  “My Lord, your seeking my pardon... well that’s not in any way fit or proper. You are the first born of the Emperor. I am after all an orphan, a child abandoned by her parents.”  “No, Nandini. You are not an orphan.”  \\x0c“Yes, the Senior Pazhuvettaraiyar was kind enough to accept me as his wife. Even then..... “  “Not only that, Nandini. I don’t know how I am going to tell this to you... “  “You can tell anything to this inane girl. You need not have any reservation. Even those who are just roaming on the streets have something to tell me. They go out of the way to insult me.”  “Nandini, from now on if anybody insults you I can’t be patient. You need to just tell me. I will punish the person who dares to insult you.”  “You have been affectionate to me right from the beginning. You have even fought with the Pazhaiyaarai Princess on my behalf. She is your sister, my Lord.”  “Nandini you too are my sister like Kunthavai. I am your brother.”  “My Lord, since I have become somebody’s wife you are treating me like your sister. That is something befitting to your lineage. But how can I consider the Emperor’s son, the one who is born to rule the whole world as my brother?”  “You have not understood me, Nandini. You are really my sister. You are the Emperor’s daughter.”  \\x0cNandini laughed as if she heard a joke. “Are you all right, Prince? Or have I gone insane? I don’t know.”  “I am sane. So are you.”  “Then why are you teasing an orphan?”  “Look at my eyes, Nandini. Do I look like a person who will tease you?”  “Look at my eyes, Prince. Do I look like the Emperor’s daughter? Do I have any of the royal signs on my face?”  “Nandini, I have been seeing your face since you were five. I have always been mesmerized by the radiant beauty of your face. I know the reason for it only now. Only on my way from Kanchi did I know the reason for your unusual beauty. Amongst the women married in the Chozha clan there is no one equal to the beauty of Kalyani, daughter of Vaithumbarayan. Her beauty is world famous. She is my grandmother. She is still alive. She lives in Pazhaiyaarai now. At seventy her beauty is still matchless. It is very difficult to look straight into her face. She is so beautiful. All her beauty has taken refuge in you. I don’t have that kind of beauty. Nor does Princess Kunthavai or my brother Arulmozhi. My grandmother’s beauty has come to you through my father.”  “What is that you are talking, Prince? I think I have lost my mind. Or there should be some problem with my hearing.”  \\x0c“No, Nandini. You are all right. Your mind is all right. Your ears are working well. You are my father’s daughter. That makes you my sister. Before marrying my mother the Emperor fell in love with a noble lady of Srilanka and married her. You are her daughter. And hence my sister.”  Karikalan was quite enthusiastic. Nandini appeared shocked. She was staring at the Crown Prince for a while. Then her face became clear again. “My Lord, is this the news you came to know after you left Kanchi?”  “Yes, Nandini. Once I knew that, everything became clear. That information was the missing piece in the jigsaw puzzle of my life.”  “My Lord, who told you that news? Was it by any chance, Vandhiya Thevan?”  “You are right. He told me the news. But he did not say that on his own. Princess Kunthavai conveyed it through him.”  “Now I understand. People have been conspiring to keep us apart from very early days. Looks like the conspirators are still busy in their avowed mission.”  \\x0c“You are wrong, Nandini. There is no conspiracy here. When we were young the Queen Mother struggled hard to keep us apart. At that time I did not understand her actions. In fact I was furious with her. Only now I know that she has saved us from a great disaster. They could have been more transparent. They could have told us the truth earlier. A great injustice has been meted out to you because they withheld the truth. They have wronged me as well. Let the past be past. Let us forget it. Even if we cannot forget let us at least forgive them.”  “Did Vandhiya Thevan tell you just this or is there something more to the story?”  “Why do you use the word ‘story’ Nandini? Don’t you believe that?”  “That is not believable, Prince. If I had been born as the Emperor’s daughter why should I reach this state? Why did I have to suffer so much? Ok, let it be true. I want to know whether he said something else.”  Karikalan hesitated. And then poured out everything. “Yes, he also told me that you are now with the conspirators of the Pandya Kingdom. And you have taken a vow to destroy the Chozha clan. And that you are worshipping a knife on whose handle there is the fish emblem of the Pandyas. He also told me that you crowned a little boy as the Pandya King at the War Memorial on the banks of Coleroon River. Forget it, Nandini. You too have a right to share the glory of the Chozha Kingdom. You are the daughter of the reigning Emperor Sundara Chozhan. You are our dear sister. It will be my first duty to right all the wrongs done to you.”  “Lord, do you believe these stories? Then why did you wait for so many days? Why didn’t you try to talk to me earlier?”  “I was confused, Nandini. I needed some time to understand this new relationship. I was also looking for the right time to explain everything to you. This is not something which I can share with you in the presence of others. Thanks to a wild boar and a leopard I got the opportunity today.”  “The wild animals are dangerous. But not as dangerous as human beings. I realise the truth only now.”  “Sister, you said earlier that we cannot forget the past. I agreed. I asked you to at least forgive if you can’t forget what happened in the past. You have not responded to my request till now.”  “My Lord, I’ll forgive whatever you did to me in the past. Perhaps I may forget them too. But I can never forget or forgive what you did to me today.”  “What did I do today? I never betrayed you or let you down.”  “I am coming to that. Look at that scoundrel.”  “You mean, Vandhiya Thevan?”  “Yes. You asked him to come with the head of the Leopard. He is coming empty handed. He saw me in Thanjavur one day. He told me that if he was touched  \\x0ceven by my feet he would consider it a blessing. I did not even want to kick him. I told him I was going to call the guards. He ran away. Because I did not yield to his lust, he has spun this yarn to you. He promised to bring your head to me if I wanted to. He is afraid that I might share these things with you. That was why he went out of the way to prevent your coming to Kadambur. And that is why he never leaves your side. He is a treacherous black guard. I don’t even want to touch him with my feet. And you made him hug me and touch all over my body and carry me from the lake. And you were seeing that with your own eyes. Now tell me can I ever forget this? Or even forgive?”  Nandini’s eyes had gone red. She was trembling in anger. After hearing her Karikalan felt giddy. He felt as if the lake, the trees in the forest and the Mandapam were all going in circles. “My dear sister, Nandini! Can it be true? I don’t know who I should believe. Can Vandhiya Thevan be so wicked? I even thought of getting him married to that silly girl Manimekalai?”  “You need not believe my words, Prince. You always take rash decisions. Please don’t do that now. Just observe him for two days. You will know.”  \\x0cChapter 46 - The Boat Moved Away  Vandhiya Thevan came towards the Prince and Nandini from one side while Manimekalai came from the other. She was almost running towards them repeating the words “Akka, lunch is served.”  Karikalan looked in both the directions. “Nandini, it was not just Vandhiya Thevan who wanted to prevent me from coming to Kadambur. A Vaishnavite by name Azhwarkkadian too advised me against this visit. And to cap it all, the Chief Minister, my father’s best friend and a person whom I worship also gave a similar warning.”  “Chief Minister Aniruddhar is your father’s best friend. And that’s why he wants to take your father’s life. You worship him. That’s why he wants to be doubly sure that you don’t get the Crown.”  “But why?”  “The Chief Minister thinks you are short tempered and immature. He thinks that you are an atheist, or at least a person who does not have enough devotion. He has a long range plan. He wants your brother to ascend the Chozha throne. And then he will convert him to Vaishnavism. Very soon Vaishnavism will become the religion of the State. That’s his ambition. But when your brother went missing on the high seas all his plans were spoiled.”  \\x0c“But why should all of them prevent me from coming to Kadambur?”  “I am the only one who knows what’s in their minds. They may be afraid that I might tell you everything.”  “How do you know their minds?”  “Your Majesty has forgotten the fact that I happen to be the sister of that Vaishnavite fanatic Azhwarkkadian.”  “Are you really his blood sister? Do you want me to believe that story?”  “I never believed that story myself. I don’t want you to believe that either. I grew up in his father’s house. That’s why he calls me his sister. He used to say that I am an incarnation of Andal, one of the twelve Azhwars. He wants me to go with him from place to place singing the compositions of Azhwars and spread Vaishnavism.”  “Did he want to make you a Vaishnavite Nun like there are nuns in Buddhism?”  “No, it’s worse. He wanted to marry me. And wanted to travel around as a couple singing devotional songs. He also wanted me to bear many children for him all with a view to propagate Vaishnavism.”  “Oh My God! Where is that monkey-face Thirumalai and where are you? Did he  \\x0creally want to marry you?”  “That’s my bad luck, Prince. Perhaps I was born at an inauspicious time. Any man who comes near me does so only with a lustful motive.”  “Why do you want to accuse all men simply because of what the old man Pazhuvettaraiyar did to you?”  “Lord, I beg you; please don’t talk ill of Pazhuvettaraiyar in my presence. He fell in love with me. And he married me. It was a lawful wedding. He made an orphan girl his Queen. He made me live in a palace and enjoy the royal privileges.”  “But what do you want, Nandini? Do you really love him? Have you really accepted him as your husband? Then. .. . then... ”  “No! I am deeply indebted to him. That’s all. It’s just gratitude and nothing more. We are not living as man and wife. Prince, you should understand that I was born in a poor family and was abandoned by my parents. I gave my heart only to one man. I will never take it back or give it to another.”  “Who is that lucky fellow, Nandini? No, you need not answer that question. But answer this - who are you? If you are not my father’s daughter, if you are not my sister, and if you are not Azhwarkkadian’s sister, then who are you? I’ll be grateful if you just answer this question, Nandini. Please. If I don’t know the answer to that question I am afraid I’ll lose my mind.”  \\x0c“I am dying to tell you, Prince. But see your friend and my friend have come very near. I’ll tell you when we meet next.”  Nandini spoke to Vandhiya Thevan who had reached them:  “What is this? Your hands are empty? What happened to the leopard’s head?”  “Devi, I am not fortunate enough to place the head of leopard at your feet.”  “Is this valour? You used to sing songs about your ancestors. You used to sing that your forefathers planted the heads of the Three Great Kings, the Cheras, Chozhas and Pandyas on the field instead of paddy saplings.”  “What is that song?” - The Crown Prince was curious. “Are you going to speak or shall I do it for you?” - There was sarcasm in Nandini’s voice. “Devi, I don’t remember telling you about such a song.” “You have forgotten. But I have not. Listen. Making the fallen army a natural manure With their flowing blood doing the function of water In the field of dirt ploughed by the elephant  \\x0cThe Vaana King, the best of Royal blood Planted the heads of the three emperors The Cheras, the Chozhas and the Pandyas. Nandini was in a devastating mood at that time. “My Lord, how is the song? You beheaded just the Pandya King. But this man’s ancestors plucked the heads of all the three emperors and planted them in their field as if they were saplings.”  Nandini succeeded eminently in her mission for there was fury and disgust on the face of the Crown Prince. “ Great planting! Great farming! ” And then he broke out into a loud laugh more to hide his disgust. Vandhiya Thevan did not have the courage to face his employer. He had to take enormous efforts to steady himself  He spoke to Nandini in a hesitant voice:  “Devi, I have never talked about that song to you.”  “So what? If you don’t know about the glory of your ancestors it’s time to learn. Having come from a clan which used the heads of emperors as saplings in a  \\x0cfarm you can’t bring the head of a wounded leopard. Shame on you!”  “What can I do, Devi? The wounded leopard is dead. I don’t want to behead a dead leopard.”  “How did that happen? I saw the beast slowly getting into the boat.” The Prince was surprised. “It was I who showed that to you, my Lord. It got into the boat, lay down and then died peacefully. Perhaps it would have felt guilty that it had hurt the Junior Queen of Pazhuvur.”  The Crown Prince cooled down. “It could have died in water. Why did it get into the boat?”  “Perhaps, it’s also like me, Your Highness. Afraid of water. Of all the ways of dying I dread dying in water.”  “But a short while ago you jumped courageously into water? Perhaps you have so much of compassion for this silly girl.” Nandini was not yet finished. “Devi, honestly, I am more afraid of women than water. I jumped in because the Prince ordered me to do so. Only now do I realise that I need not have jumped at all.”  \\x0c“Yes, yes. Now I remember. You are afraid of falling in water. You are never afraid of pushing somebody into water and drowning them.”  Nandini was cleverly alluding to the drowning accident involving Arulmozhivarman. Manimekalai did not like the way the conversation went. And that clearly showed in her face. “Akka, the food is getting cold. Come let’s go.”  All the four started to walk towards the Mandapam. Manimekalai stole a few glances at Vandhiya Thevan. She knew intuitively that Vandhiya Thevan was in trouble and that the Prince and Nandini were somehow the reason for it. “Let the whole world oppose you. I’ll be on your side, my dear. Don’t ever worry.”  She wanted to tell these words through her eyes if only Vandhiya Thevan looked at her. But Vandhiya Thevan did not look at her even once. He was lost in his own world of grief. Nandini’s treacherous words, the great charge she levelled on Vandhiya Thevan must have shocked and repulsed any sensitive being. That is quite natural. But if anyone cares to know a little more about her he would not be shocked. The qualities of a man or woman largely depend on heredity. They are also greatly influenced by habits and circumstances. Mandhakini, a dumb and deaf woman, lived mostly in the forests. She had to be extremely careful for she was virtually living with the wild animals. At times she had to mercilessly kill those animals to save her life. Her mind was as pure as the milk for a long time. And then the sweet elixir of love was added to that milk when she met her first and only love in her life, Sundara Chozhan. But soon the fountain of love went dry and her life became as dry as a desert. She was disappointed when Destiny played a cruel game in her life. The shock was so much for her that at one point of time she almost lost her sanity. But as time passed on, the wounds in her heart healed. Love came into her life for the second time. The enormous love she had for Sundara Chozhan soon evolved into a motherly love for his son, Arulmozhivarman. Nandini was Mandhakini’s daughter. She inherited almost all the traits of her mother. But the world was even harsher to the daughter than the mother. Nandini was abandoned at birth by her mother. She grew up in a stranger’s house. She suffered more from human beings than her mother, from the wild animals of the forest. When she was insulted and ridiculed by the children of the Royal family, her heart hardened. All her ill-feelings crystallized into hatred - harder than a rock and more lethal than the world’s deadliest poison. If only she had had some love in her life the hatred in her mind would have been to that extent diluted. She never had it. Whosoever loved her either ignored and insulted her or died all of a sudden and vanished from her life. Those who insulted her and those who were hated by her lived a glorious life. What else is needed to make a girl’s mind turn into poison? The only feeling that filled up her mind was a thirst for revenge against those who hated and insulted her. She had a natural ability to scheme - something she had even when she was in her mother’s womb. Her life was full of disappointments and grief thanks to which all soft feelings had died an early and inglorious death in her heart. And her heart was as hard as the galvanised steel. Without understanding Nandini’s mind it is almost impossible to follow the story line. The four people had their lunch in relative silence. It was a kind of picnic lunch and a happy conversation should have accompanied it. But it did not. Nandini, Karikalan and Vandhiya Thevan were lost in their own personal thoughts and grief. Manimekalai was the one who suffered the most. She loved Nandini. And she had made elaborate arrangements for the picnic and the lunch only to spend some happy time with the Pazhuvur Queen and play some water-games with her. When the Prince and Vandhiya Thevan unexpectedly joined the party at first she was excited. But then she was put off by the way the three people talked and behaved with respect to one another. Manimekalai was gifted with the mind of an innocent child. She soon forgot seeing Vandhiya Thevan holding Nandini in his hand. She even regretted the momentary feelings of jealousy that passed her mind when she saw them together. But she could never understand the not so happy conversation among those three people and the frown in their faces. She did not understand their conversation let alone like it. A few minutes after lunch Manimekalai spoke to Nandini in a listless voice:  “Akka, shall we go back? Shall I ask the boat to be brought in? Are these people coming with us?”  Karikalan was shaken from his reverie. “Aha! How can we go back without listening to this girl’s music concert? Never. Nandini, have you forgotten or what? Manimekalai, we have been waiting to listen to you. Please don’t disappoint us.”  Nandini spoke for both. “No, Prince, I have not forgotten that. But you and your friend do not seem to be in a mood to enjoy music. You look as if you are standing on a sharp thorn and in a hurry to go. It’s all right. Manimekalai, please bring your Yazh.”  “Why should I Akka? Why do you force me to play music before those who do not like it?”  “No, no! Didn’t you hear the Prince? He is eager to listen to your performance. And if his friend doesn’t like music let him close his ears.”  \\x0c“Oh My God! I don’t hate music. A boat-woman by name Poonkuzhali sang a beautiful song. I become ecstatic when I think of that song:  When the sea is still and so is the wave Why should the inner sea rant and rave When the earth-maid is asleep Why should the heart be restless and weep”  “Some people prefer to hear the songs sung by a chosen few. I am not sure whether you’ll like mine.”  Karikalan pacified her. “I’ll make him listen to your music, Manimekalai. I stand guarantee for Vandhya Thevan. Now be a good girl and bring your Yazh.”  Manimekalai obeyed. She sat on the top step of the Mandapam. She tightened the strings in the instrument and set the harmony. The instrument had seven strings. Each string could play two notes. For a while Manimekalai played the stringed instrument and filled the place with melodious music. Music in a way was a kind of powerful magic for within a few seconds Karikalan and Vandhya Thevan forgot all their problems. For a while there was nothing in their hearts except Manimekalai’s music. And then Manimekalai sang. At first she confined herself only to some devotional numbers especially the compositions of Saivite saints like  \\x0cThirunavukkarasar and Sundara Murthi Nayanar. The Prince then expressed his desire:  “Manimekalai your songs are out of the world. But why do you confine yourself to just devotional numbers? You know very well I am not into too much of devotion and spirituality. Whatever devotion to Lord Shiva I had I have given up in favour of my uncle Madhuranthakan. Why don’t you sing a love song for me?”  Manimekalai’s beautiful cheeks turned blood red. She was a little hesitant. The Prince tried his best to assuage her feelings. “Why do you hesitate, girl? Well, if you sing a love song, I won’t think that you have me in your mind. Nor my friend here will have such wrong notions. So please go ahead and sing, Manimekalai.”  Nandini was quick to intervene. “Even if somebody thinks that she sings only for him, Manimekalai would not bother.”  “Akka! Why are you teasing me in the presence of these men?”  “The mistake is not in me, Manimekalai. It’s in your thinking. You think that these two people are men. That is fundamentally wrong. How can you consider somebody who cannot even bring the head of a dead leopard as a man? In the  \\x0cgood old days the warriors of Tamilnadu used to catch a tiger alive, open its mouth, extricate its teeth and make it as a jewel for their beloved. Those days are all gone. Let’s not worry about that now. You sing, Manimekalai. You sang a song to me the other day. That was beautiful. Why don’t you sing that song for these people?”  Manimekalai played the Yazh and sang simultaneously. When she sang of love there was an additional dose of sweetness in her voice. The rendering was very soft but very touching. Is that all a dream, my friend The time we spent together On the slopes of the mountain Besides the waterfalls Beneath the shadow of fruit-laden trees When he held my hand And we were both lost in happiness Is that all a dream, my friend Or just a thought in my mind In the grove of punnai trees Under the golden rays of the evening sun He called me near And whispered words of love In my ears  \\x0cIs that all a dream my friend Is that miracle nothing but a lie? Defying all security Like a thief he walked in stealth And with boundless love Held me in embrace And smothered me with kisses Did it happen? Weren’t we happy? Is that all a dream, my friend Or just a thought in my mind  Several stanzas followed, each set to a different tune. All the three were drowned in that sublime music. Nandini had made her heart harder than a rock due to various reasons that were peculiar to her life. Even she was shedding tears, thanks to the power of music and the emotion in Manimekalai’s voice. The Crown Prince forgot this world. Vandhiya Thevan looked at Manimekalai every now and then as if he just recovered from a shock. And every time he saw her he found that she was looking at him with all the love in the world. Vandhiya Thevan was in for a greater shock. “Oh My God! I have wronged this angel. I have made her think that I am in love with her.” His mind was filled with remorse. Being submerged in the world of music and emotions they did not notice that the  \\x0cwind was becoming stronger and stronger. They did not see the small wavelets in the lake had grown into large waves. They did not notice that the breeze had become a wind and the wind had become a storm. Only when a huge tree was uprooted by the force of wind did they wake up to reality. They saw all the signs of a storm. They saw the noisy waves hitting the shore. Nandini was the first to notice that. “Oh My God! Where is our boat?” She virtually screamed. The boat was not in its usual resting place. When they looked far into the lake they could see the small figure of the boat being tossed away in water. It was moving deeper and deeper into water. “Aiyoo! What can we do now? We are stranded.” Nandini screamed again. “If you ladies know horse riding please take our horses. We’ll manage.”  “Are you planning to have us killed, being caught under the huge trees which might fall in this gale?”  Karikalan was not affected. “There is no need to go now. Let us remain here till the storm subsides. What are we going to do at the Palace? See we have enough food. At least we have the materials and utensils. Manimekalai is there to entertain us with her songs. I have never been this happy in the recent past.”  \\x0cVandhiya Thevan was concerned. “That’s not proper, Your Highness. What will Sambuvaraiyar and Kandhanmaran think of us?”  “I suspect this man should have let loose the boat in the pretext of looking out for the leopard r.”  “Akka, why do you blame him? Even when he came here I saw the boat near the shore. Let us not worry, Akka. My father, when he sees the storm, will send a boat to rescue us.”  Soon her words became true. A few minutes later two large boats, which from a distance looked like ships, came towards the island. Sambuvaraiyar was in one of them. He was happy to see all the four safe and happy. They boarded the boat. The lake resembled an ocean in turbulence. A greater storm was raging in the minds of all the four who were rescued. Sambuvaraiyar was the only one who remained calm. ***'"
